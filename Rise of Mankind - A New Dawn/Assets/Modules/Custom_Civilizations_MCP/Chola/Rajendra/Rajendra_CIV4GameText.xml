		<English>[H1]Rajendra Chola I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of the Cholas[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: ? - 1044 CE[\BOLD][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2]Rajendra Chola I was the son of Rajaraja Chola I, the great Chola king of South India. Rajendra formally ascended the Chola throne in 1014 CE, two years after his installation as the Co Regent. He placed a son on the throne at Madurai, completed the conquest of Ceylon, overran the Deccan (c. 1021), and sent (1023) an expedition to the north that penetrated to the Ganges River and brought Ganges water to the new capital, Gangaikondacolapuram.[PARAGRAPH:2]Before the fourteenth year of Rajendra’s reign c. 1025, the Chola Navy crossed the ocean and attacked the Srivijaya kingdom of Sangrama Vijayatungavarman. Kadaram, the capital of the powerful maritime kingdom, was sacked and the king taken captive. Along with Kadaram, Pannai in present day Sumatra and Malaiyur in the Malayan peninsula were attacked. Kedah (now in modern Malaysia) too was occupied. There are no records to explain the nature of and the reason for this naval expedition. The Sailendra dynasty had been in good relations with the Chola Empire during the period of Rajaraja Chola I. Rajaraja encouraged Mara Vijayatungavarman to build the Chudamani Vihara at Nagapattinam. Rajendra confirmed this grant in the Anaimangalam grants showing that the relationship with Srivijaya was still continued be friendly. The exact cause of the quarrel that caused the naval war between Cholas and Srivijaya remains unknown.[PARAGRAPH:2]Rajendra’s long reign saw almost continuous campaigns and conflicts trying to hold his huge empire together. Rajendra’s sons carried out most of the campaigns during the late period of his reign. The emperor refrained from taking the field personally allowing his sons to win glory and distinction. The closing years of Rajendra forms the most splendid period of Cholas. The extent of the empire was the widest and the military and naval prestige was at its highest. The emperor was ably assisted by his sons and other members of his family. The Chola imperialism was a benevolent one attested by the presence of the traditional rulers in the Pandya and Kerala countries and the act of reinstating the Srivijaya king after his defeat.</English>
