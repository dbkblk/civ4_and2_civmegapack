		<English>[TAB]While not necessarily this is specific to Romania - it is more correct to say this was some kind of "feudal privilege" granted to "free villages" (or to the "free peasant" - razeshi or moshneni - communities). The "serf villages" (satele de iobagi in Romanian) didn't have the right to build mills, forges or to have their own forests. They had to "buy" this services/products from their "master" ( boier in Romanian ) or "supervising" monastery ( if this was the case ) - with money or, more likely, working a number of days the land of their landlords. Opposite to this - the "free villages" had the granted right ( usually from the king - voievod or domn in Romanian ) to posses a "communal mills", or forges, judge some minor delicts by elder, even to trade non-agricultural products and so on. Most of these villages was founded in border-regions and, for their status, need to send soldiers (armed by the village) in case of war.[NEWLINE]This was a successful "social arrangement" for more than 2 centuries (XIVth-XVIth) and provided enough partially-trained soldiers to defend with some good military victories against superior enemy forces (Turkish, Polish, Hungarians and so on). Unfortunately - starting with the beginning of XVIth century the two Romanians principates ruled by Romanian lords (Walachia and Moldavia) - became the stage of internal fighting between landlords in order to impose a "friendly" king. The land and revenues of "free-villages" was a good motivation for the greed of "boier-s and their abuse. In less than a century most of "free peasant" was transformed to serfs and the remaining ones was forced to accept reduction of their "feudal privileges". Despite the fact that those measure reduced the army and capacity of defense - the fear of nobleman for possible peasant uprising lead to drastically reduction of pre-existent "peasant militia". Even so, especially in western part of Walachia, there remains "traces" of old organization until the end of XIXth century (those man formed the main part of Tudor Vladimirescu's revolutionary units in 1821).</English>
