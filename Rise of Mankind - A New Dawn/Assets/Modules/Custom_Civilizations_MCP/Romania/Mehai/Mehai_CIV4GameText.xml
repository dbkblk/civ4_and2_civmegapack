       	<English>[H1]Mihai Viteazul[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prince of Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldovia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Ruled: [\BOLD] 1593 - 1601[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Argued by many to have been the illegitimate son of Wallachian Prince Patrascu cel Bun (a matter which is unclear, and could have been used by Michael himself in order to justify his rule), he became the Ban of Mehedinti in 1588, stolnic at the court of Mihnea Turcitul by the end of 1588, and Ban of Craiova in 1593 - during the rule of Alexandru cel Rau. In September 1593 with the help of the Ottoman Empire, he became the Prince of Wallachia, starting his effective rule on October 11.    Not long after this, he began to fight his Ottoman overlord. The next year he joined a Christian alliance of European powers against the Turks, and signed treaties with Sigismund Bathory of Transylvania and Aron Voda of Moldavia. He started a campaign against the Turks in the autumn of 1594, conquering several citadels near the Danube, including Giurgiu, Braila, Harsova, and Silistra.  In 1595, at Alba Iulia (Gyulafehervar), Michael signed a treaty with Sigismund Bathory, through which Wallachia came under the sovereignty of Transylvania, while the latter was required to send aid to fight the Ottomans. On August 13, 1595, at the Battle of Calugareni (near the Neajlov river), Michael defeated an Ottoman army led by Sinan Pasha.  Despite the victory, because he had too few troops to mount a full scale battle, he retreated toward Transylvania. Together with Sigismund Bathory's 40,000-strong army (led by Stephen Bocskai), he captured Targoviste (October 8), Bucharest (October 12) and Braila, temporarily removing Wallachia from Ottoman rule. The fight against the Ottomans continued in 1596, when Michael made several incursions south of the Danube at Vidin, Pleven, Nicopolis, and Babadag.[NEWLINE][TAB]In April 1598 Sigismund resigned as Prince of Transylvania in favor of the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf II (who was also the King of Hungary), reversed his decision in October 1598, and then resigned again in favor of Cardinal Andrew Bathory, his cousin. This allowed Transylvania to fall under the influence of the King of Poland, Sigismund III Vasa, while Michael reestablished a relationship with his sole ally, Emperor Rudolf. Michael subsequently began a campagain against Transylvania on October 5, 1599, while the Habsburg general Giorgio Basta entered Transylvania from the west at the same time.  On October 18, Michael obtained an important victory against Andrew Bathory in the Battle of Selimbar, giving him control of Transylvania. With impressive pomp, Michael entered the Transylvanian capital at Alba Iulia, and received the keys to the fortress from Bishop Demeter Napragy (depicted as a seminal event in later Romanian historiography).  Because Michael claimed the Partium region and refused to recognize Rudolf's rights over Transylvania, the Emperor ceased subsidizing Michael's army. In order to acquire vital funds, he began a military campaign against Moldavia, defeating the combined Polish and Moldavian army of Ieremia Movila at Bacau, a victory which led to the first rule over the three neighboring principalities (although Wallachia was officially ruled by Nicolae Patrascu).  Neighboring states were alarmed by this upsetting of the balance of power, especially the Hungarian nobility in Transylvania, which rose against Michael in rebellion. With the help of Basta, they defeated Michael at the Battle of Miraslau, forcing the prince to leave Transylvania. A Polish army led by Jan Zamoyski drove the Wallachians from Moldavia and defeated Michael at Naieni, Ceptura, and Bucov (Battle of the Teleajan River). The Polish army also entered eastern Wallachia and established Simion Movila as ruler. Forces loyal to Michael remained only in Oltenia.[NEWLINE][TAB]Michael again asked for assistance from Rudolf, which was granted when the emperor heard Basta had lost control of Transylvania to the Hungarian nobility led by Sigismund Bathory. Meanwhile, forces loyal to Michael in Wallachia, after a first unsuccessful attempt, drove out Simion Movila and prepared to reenter Transylvania. Michael, allied with Basta, defeated the Hungarian nobility at Guraslau (Goroszlo). Nonetheless, Basta then ordered the assassination of Michael, which took place in Campia Turzii on 9 August 1601.  Michael the Brave's rule, with its break with Ottoman rule, tense relations with other European powers and with the union of the three states, was considered in following periods as the precursor of a modern Romania - a thesis which was argued with noted intensity by Nicolae Balcescu (and became a point of reference for nationalists, as well as a catalysis of various Romanian forces in order to achieve a single Romanian state).  Michael is also commemorated by the monks of the Athonite Simonopetra Monastery for his great contributions in the form of land and money to rebuilding the monastery which had been destroyed by a fire.</English>

The fight against the Ottomans continued in 1596, when Michael made several incursions south of the Danube at Vidin, Pleven, Nicopolis, and Babadag.[NEWLINE][TAB]In April 1598 Sigismund resigned as Prince of Transylvania in favor of the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf II (who was also the King of Hungary), reversed his decision in October 1598, and then resigned again in favor of Cardinal Andrew Bathory, his cousin. This allowed Transylvania to fall under the influence of the King of Poland, Sigismund III Vasa, while Michael reestablished a relationship with his sole ally, Emperor Rudolf. Michael subsequently began a campagain against Transylvania on October 5, 1599, while the Habsburg general Giorgio Basta entered Transylvania from the west at the same time.  On October 18, Michael obtained an important victory against Andrew Bathory in the Battle of Selimbar, giving him control of Transylvania. With impressive pomp, Michael entered the Transylvanian capital at Alba Iulia, and received the keys to the fortress from Bishop Demeter Napragy (depicted as a seminal event in later Romanian historiography).  Because Michael claimed the Partium region and refused to recognize Rudolf's rights over Transylvania, the Emperor ceased subsidizing Michael's army. In order to acquire vital funds, he began a military campaign against Moldavia, defeating the combined Polish and Moldavian army of Ieremia Movila at Bacau, a victory which led to the first rule over the three neighboring principalities (although Wallachia was officially ruled by Nicolae Patrascu).  Neighboring states were alarmed by this upsetting of the balance of power, especially the Hungarian nobility in Transylvania, which rose against Michael in rebellion. With the help of Basta, they defeated Michael at the Battle of Miraslau, forcing the prince to leave Transylvania. A Polish army led by Jan Zamoyski drove the Wallachians from Moldavia and defeated Michael at Naieni, Ceptura, and Bucov (Battle of the Teleajan River). The Polish army also entered eastern Wallachia and established Simion Movila as ruler. Forces loyal to Michael remained only in Oltenia.[NEWLINE][TAB]Michael again asked for assistance from Rudolf, which was granted when the emperor heard Basta had lost control of Transylvania to the Hungarian nobility led by Sigismund Bathory. Meanwhile, forces loyal to Michael in Wallachia, after a first unsuccessful attempt, drove out Simion Movila and prepared to reenter Transylvania. Michael, allied with Basta, defeated the Hungarian nobility at Guraslau (Goroszlo). Nonetheless, Basta then ordered the assassination of Michael, which took place in Campia Turzii on 9 August 1601.  Michael the Brave's rule, with its break with Ottoman rule, tense relations with other European powers and with the union of the three states, was considered in following periods as the precursor of a modern Romania - a thesis which was argued with noted intensity by Nicolae Balcescu (and became a point of reference for nationalists, as well as a catalysis of various Romanian forces in order to achieve a single Romanian state).  Michael is also commemorated by the monks of the Athonite Simonopetra Monastery for his great contributions in the form of land and money to rebuilding the monastery which had been destroyed by a fire.</Japanese>

In September 1593 with the help of the Ottoman Empire, he became the Prince of Wallachia, starting his effective rule on October 11.    Not long after this, he began to fight his Ottoman overlord. The next year he joined a Christian alliance of European powers against the Turks, and signed treaties with Sigismund Bathory of Transylvania and Aron Voda of Moldavia. He started a campaign against the Turks in the autumn of 1594, conquering several citadels near the Danube, including Giurgiu, Braila, Harsova, and Silistra.  In 1595, at Alba Iulia (Gyulafehervar), Michael signed a treaty with Sigismund Bathory, through which Wallachia came under the sovereignty of Transylvania, while the latter was required to send aid to fight the Ottomans. On August 13, 1595, at the Battle of Calugareni (near the Neajlov river), Michael defeated an Ottoman army led by Sinan Pasha.  Despite the victory, because he had too few troops to mount a full scale battle, he retreated toward Transylvania.
