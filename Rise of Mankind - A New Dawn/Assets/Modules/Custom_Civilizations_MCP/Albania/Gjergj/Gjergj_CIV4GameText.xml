During this time the feudal lords were all vying for the most power in Albania, while paying tribute to the Ottoman Sultan, which established himself as overlord of the Balkans.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gjergj became involved in politics at an early age, taking trips for his father to the Republic of Venice as a teenager, meeting with cardinals and politicians to discuss the problematic presence of the Ottoman Turks.  This earned him much respect throughout the diplomatic world, along with contacts that he would keep until his death.[PARAGRAPH:1]In order to ensure fidelity to the Sultan, Gjon Kastrioti was required to give up his son to the Empire for service.  Determined to keep his father's possession of Kruja Gjergj joined the Ottoman Empire as a soldier, but never forgot his country, vowing to one day return.  Excelling at warfare, Gjergj quickly rose through the ranks of the Ottoman Army, establishing his natural talent for battle, and gaining an intimate knowledge of Ottoman warfare tactics.[PARAGRAPH:1]Upon Gjon's death in 1443, Sultan Murad claimed for himself the Kastrioti's castle at Kruja.  This, along with his people's lamentations, indicated the need for Kastrioti to take action against the Empire, and rekindled his sense of Albanian pride.  He waited patiently for the most opportune moment to make his move.[PARAGRAPH:1] It came in November of 1443 when Kastrioti, in agreement with Janosh Hunyadi of the Hungarians (at that time the main force opposing Ottoman rule in the Balkans), left the Ottoman ranks with a contingent of Albanian horsemen to reclaim his castle at Kruja.  On March 2, 1444 he united all Albanian princes, land barons, and tribal chieftains at the principality of Lezha in open rebellion against the occupation of the Ottoman armies. He managed to secure nominal support from the Venetian Republic, the Arogonese King of Naples, the kingdom of Spain, the Hungarians, and the Popes of the Holy Catholic Church, which gave him the title "Athleta Christi" (Athlete of Christendom).[PARAGRAPH:1] The Albanians under Kastrioti's leadership were able to defeat the most powerful army in the world for 25 years, and kept them from setting foot inside Catholic Western Europe.  By using his knowledge of Ottoman battle tactics, and employing the Kalorse, a fast, Light Guerilla Cavalry, (which could outrun Ottoman forces and cause chaos within enemy ranks), Kastrioti ensured easy victory for the Albanians.[PARAGRAPH:1] About 10 years after Kastrioti's death in 1468, the Turks tore open his grave in search of his bones which they used as talismans, believing that they held mythical power.  The Albanians held out for 12 more years, but could not withstand the might of Mehmet the Conqueror without the genius leadership of their hero.  By 1480, all of Albania was conquered by the Ottoman Empire.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gjergj Kastrioti's efforts were not in vain, however.  As the father of the Albanian rebellion, Kastrioti was the only man in history ever to completely unite the Albanians.  He was the author of the Albanian national existance, and his people even to this day say his name proudly as they raise the Albanian flag that he once raised to show the world that the Albanians desired freedom, and they would fight to get it.</English>
