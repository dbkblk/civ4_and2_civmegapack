		<English>[TAB]Albania is experienced by Civilization standards; home to the ancient Illyrians, the first people in the Balkans, Albania has housed the most ancient surviving race in Europe.  The Albanians, like their Illyrian ancestors, lived primarily in tribal and clan structures.  Rival clans competed with each other for much of their existance, resulting in disunity amongst the tribes, which fell victim to 33 armed invasions.  The central theme of Albania's history is that of the struggle and suffering of a fiercely independent but hopelessly outnumbered people against the tide of conquest in Europe.[PARAGRAPH:2] The term "Albanian" was first mentioned in a document by a Byzantine emperor in 1081.  This generic name classified all remaining Illyrians by the name of a single tribe, the Albani, situated in central Albania.  It was the Illyrians in the southern part of the Balkans which averted assimilation from the Slavic invaders that their north Balkan counterparts fell victim to.  Beginning with these invasions was the start of tensions between the Albanians and the Slavs, which have been at war with each other throughout much of their respective histories.[PARAGRAPH:2] Albania's Golden Age occurred in 1443 with the inception of the rebellion of Gjergj Kastrioti, the military strategist that managed to secure support from Christian Europe in continually defeating the Ottoman Empire in battle.  His success lay not only in the genius that he possessed, but also in the unity of the Albanians: Gjergj Kastrioti was the only man in Albania's history to completely unite the Albanian tribes.  Under the battle cry of a united, independent Albania, Gjergj Kastrioti waged a Holy War against the Muslim Turks with the ancient Albanian ideals of "Nation, Faith, Fatherland!"  They defeated the most powerful army in the world for 25 years until his death in 1468.  The Albanians continued their struggle under the leadership of Leke Dukagjini, but without the father of their nation they digressed into their former tribal alliegances.  The last Albanian fortress fell by 1480, and Albania was plunged into a dark age of Ottoman occupation.[PARAGRAPH:2] The Catholic Albanians initially resisted Turkish rule and sporadic revolts took place until the Turks adopted a policy of Islamicization, converting roughly 2/3 of the population to Islam over time.  This fostered even further disunity amongst the Albanians by adding a religious element of separation.  Albanian Muslims became subservient to Turkish authority and rose to positions of power and influence within the Empire.  Catholic Albanians maintained their centers of resistance, namely the mountainous Northern Highlands, and resisted Turkish rule with force.  The intelligentsia was murdered and the citizens were culturally and economically supressed.  For nearly 5 centuries the Albanians were stifled under the occupation of the Ottoman Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2] It was not until the Rilindja period in the late 19th century that nationalism prevailed over all else for the Albanians, like in the days of Gjergj Kastrioti.  The rebirth of Albanian culture and nationalism was jumpstarted by the treaty of San Stefano, a result of the Russo-Turkish war, which the Russians imposed on the Turks, forcing them to give Albanian lands to the Slavic countries of the Balkans.  The League of Prizren was formed in Kosova to combat this proposed partitioning of Albanian land to Montenegro, Serbia, and Bulgaria.  During this time Albanians began to put aside their religious and regional differences to come together to defend the land of their ancestors.  Austria-Hungary and the United Kingdom called a European conference to discuss the provisions of the Treaty of San Stefano, for they feared a Russian presence in the Balkans (through the land assigned to its Slavic brothers) would upset the European balance of power.  The Congress of Berlin (1878) decreed that Montenegro, Serbia, and Greece were to be awarded large tracts of Albanian inhabited lands.  The League of Prizren assembled troops in defense of this partitioned land, and largely succeeded in its defense, until both the Great Powers of Europe and the Ottoman Empire combined forces to defeat the Albanians and hand over the partitioned territories.  Revolts once again rose up but were of little consequence until the turn of the 20th century.[PARAGRAPH:2] On April 6, 1911, the Albanian flag was raised by Ded Gjon Luli Dedvukaj to declare independence from the Ottoman Empire for the first time in 468 years.  The Albanians had once again managed to come together for the greater good in ridding their ancestral homeland of foreign occupiers.  This revolt sparked a general rebellion all throughout Albanian inhabited lands.  In 1912 Albanians took the Turkish-held capital of the vilayet of Kosova, Shkup, and Albanians in other areas defeated Turkish armies to reclaim their lands.  Neighboring Balkan countries saw this as an opportunity to gain land, and Montenegro began the first Balkan War, along with Serbs, Bulgarians, and Greeks, to grab as much Albanian land as possible.  The Slavs took much of northern Albania, and the Greeks took large parts of southern Albania.  The Albanians quickly declared the independence of the Albanian state in the southern port city of Vlora (Valona) on November 28, 1912.  By 1913, the Treaty of Bucharest established that Albania was an independent country, albeit at half it's original size.[PARAGRAPH:2] The remainder of the 20th century saw two World Wars, hostility and border disputes, a harsh and cruel communist regime by a Stalin-like dictator, Enver Hoxha, then finally the emergence of democracy with Sali Berisha, and genocide against the Albanians of Kosova.  The story of Albania is a tragedy that is almost unknown throughout the world.  Yet, the people carry on with high hopes, despite their setting at the heart of the "powderkeg of the Balkans," which can only be neutralized by restoring Albania to its pre-Congress of Berlin ethnic borders.  Hopefully such wrongs will be reversed, and Albania will finally be able to live peacefully with its neighbors.</English>
