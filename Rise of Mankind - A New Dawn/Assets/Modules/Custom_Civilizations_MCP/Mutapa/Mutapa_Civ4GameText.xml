		<English>[TAB]The Empire of Great Zimbabwe also called Munhu mu tapa or Mwene Mutapa or Manhumutapa or Monomotapa or Mutapa was a medieval kingdom (c.1450-1629) located in Southern Africa covering mainly the modern states of Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Its capital city was the Great Zimbabwe.[PARAGRAPH:2]The empire was established by the Rozvi who are the ancestors of the modern day Shona people. Great Zimbabwe reached its zenith around the 1440s) via the Gold trade. Gold was exported from the empire to the port of Sofala south of the Zambezi delta, where Arab traders waited. The fabrics of Gujarat were traded for gold along the coast. Soon the pressures from European and Arab traders began to change the balance of power in the region.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Portuguese began their attempts to subdue the Shona state as early as 1505 but were confined to the coast for many years, according to Fernand Braudel until 1513.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Monomotapa Empire was being torn apart by rival factions, and the gold from the rivers they controlled was exhausted. The trade in gold was replaced by a trade in slaves. Around this time the Arab states of Zanzibar and Kilwa became prominent powers by providing slaves for Arabia, Persia and India.[PARAGRAPH:2]The empire was finally conquered in 1629 by the Portuguese and never recovered. Remnants of the government established another Mutapa kingdom in Mozambique sometimes called Karanga. The Karanga kings were called Mambos (plural version) and reigned in the region until 1902.[PARAGRAPH:2]The empire had another indirect side effect on the history of Southern Africa. Gold from the empire inspired in Europeans a belief that Munhumutapa held the legendary mines of King Solomon as referenced in the Bible. The belief that the mines were inside the Munhumutapa kingdom in Southern Africa was one of the factors that led to the Dutch East India Company founding the Cape colony, which would eventually lead to the creation of the country of South Africa.</English>
