		<English>[H1]Johann Rudolf Wettstein[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Swiss diplomat and mayor of Basel[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1594 - 1666 [PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Johann Rudolf Wettstein was a Swiss diplomat and one-time mayor of Basel. His father, a wine grower, had migrated from Russikon in the Zurich region and worked in the Basel hospital, eventually becoming hospital supervisor.  Wettstein himself attended the “Schule auf Burg,” the present-day secondary school located at the Münsterplatz in Basel. Afterwards he concluded a chancellery apprenticeship in Yverdon and Geneva. In 1611 Wettstein married Anna Maria Falkner. Five years later he temporarily moved to Venice for professional reasons.  In 1620, after his return to Basel, Wettstein was elected to city council. His career in the public service progressed with increasingly responsible positions. In 1635 he became senior guild master, and was elected mayor of Basel in 1645.  Wettstein participated in the negotiations for the Peace of Westphalia in 1646/47 as a delegate for the Old Swiss Confederacy, without having been invited, and initially also without accreditation by the Confederacy. After long, hard, and skilful mediation he achieved official recognition of Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire in 1648.</English>
