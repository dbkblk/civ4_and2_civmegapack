		<English>[H1]Yulia Tymoshenko[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prime Minister of Ukraine[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1960 - [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Yulia Volodymyrivna Tymoshenko is leader of the All-Ukrainian Union Fatherland party and the Yulia Tymoshenko Electoral Bloc. Prior to that she was a successful businesswoman in the gas industry and became one of the wealthiest people in Ukraine. Before becoming Ukraine's first female prime minister, she was considered the most significant ally of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko and had a very high profile during the 2004 presidential election. She was also one of the key leaders of the Orange Revolution inspired by those elections, which eventually brought Yushchenko to power. In this period, some Western media publications dubbed her "Joan of Arc of the Orange Revolution".[PARAGRAPH:1]Tymoshenko experienced a rise in power under the Soviet system, but it was after the demise of the Soviet Union that she rose to particular prominence, directing several energy-related companies and acquiring a significant fortune between 1990 and 1998. During privatisation in Ukraine, which mirrored that in Russia in terms of corruption and mismanagement, she became one of the wealthiest oligarchs in Ukraine, exporting metals. From 1995 to 1997, Tymoshenko was the president of the United Energy Systems of Ukraine, a privately owned middleman company which became the main importer of Russian natural gas in 1996. During that time she was nicknamed "gas princess" in the light of accusations she has been reselling enormous quantities of stolen Russian gas and avoiding taxation of those deals. [PARAGRAPH:1]Yulia Tymoshenko made a move into politics in 1996, and was elected to the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian parliament) from the Kirovohrad oblast, winning a record 92.3% of the vote in her constituency. She was re-elected in 1998 and 2002. In 1998, she became the Chair of the Budget Committee of Verkhovna Rada. [PARAGRAPH:1]Despite this questionable past, her transition from oligarch to reformer was believed by many to be both genuine and effective. As energy Deputy Prime Minister, she virtually ended many corrupt arrangements in the energy sector. Under her stewardship, Ukraine's revenue collections from the electricity industry grew by several thousand per cent. She scrapped the practice of barter in the electricity market, requiring industrial customers to pay for their electricity in cash. She also terminated exemptions for many organizations which excluded them from having their power disconnected. Her reforms meant that the government had sufficient funds to pay civil servants and increase salaries. [PARAGRAPH:1]However, several months into her government, a failure to deliver on the promise of reform after the Orange Revolution began to damage Tymoshenko's administration. On 8 September 2005, after the resignation of several senior officials including the Head of the Security and Defence Council Petro Poroshenko and Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Tomenko, Yulia Tymoshenko's government was dismissed by President Victor Yuschenko. It is expected that a current Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc will enter the opposition and pave the way for a run for President of Ukraine by Tymoshenko in 2009, an election many analysts say she could easily win.</English>
