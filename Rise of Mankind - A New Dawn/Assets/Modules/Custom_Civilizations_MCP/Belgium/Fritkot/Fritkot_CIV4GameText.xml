They supposedly called them "French", as it was the official language of the Belgian Army at that time.[PARAGRAPH:1]Whether or not Belgians invented them, "frites" became the national snack and a substantial part of both national dishes, making the Belgians their largest per capita consumers[citation needed] in Europe and their "symbolic" creators. The national dishes are "steak and fries with salad", and "mussels with fries".</English>
