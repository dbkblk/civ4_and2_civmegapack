		<English>[H1]Muhammad al-Amin al-Kanemi[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Islamic scholar, teacher, religious and political advisor[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1776 - 1837[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Born to a Kanembu father and an Arab mother near Murzuk in what is today Libya, al-Kanemi rose to prominence as a member of a rural religious community in the western provinces of what was then a much atrophied Kanem-Bornu Empire.  He was there in 1808 when local Fulbe rose against Bornu rule, emulating Usman Dan Fodio's "Fulani jihad" which created the Sokoto Caliphate to the west in Hausaland. While these forces took the capital of Gazargamu, elements of the Bornu state fought on and expelled the raiders. Al-Kanemi's community was one such resistant, and al-Kanemi was given credit, although he led by planning, inspiration, and prayer. He attracted a following, especially from networks Shuwa Arab and Kanembu communities extending far outside Bornu's borders. The Mai (Ruler), Dunama IX Lefiami rewarded the leader with control over a Bornu province on the Western march. Taking only the title "Shehu" ("Sheikh"), and eschewing the traditional offices, al-Kanemi gathered a powerful following, becoming both the voice of Bornu in negotiations with Sokoto, as well as a semi independent ruler of a trade rich area with a powerful military. Dunama was deposed by his uncle in 1809, but the support of al-Kanemi brought him back to power in 1813.  Al-Kanemi carried on a series of theological, legal and political debates by letter with the Sultan of Sokoto Usman dan Fodio, and later with his son, Muhammed Bello. As the expansion of Sokoto was predicated upon a struggle against paganism, apostasy, and misrule, al-Kanemi challenged the right of his neighbors to strike at a state which had been Muslim for at least 800 years. These debates, often on the nature of Jihad and Muslim rule, remain points of contention in modern Nigeria.  Al-Kanemi, not just the face of Bornu to foreign leaders, became more and more indispensable to the Mai. Some in Dunama's coterie were believed to have been behind an attempt to kill the Shehu in 1820. Open fighting resulted in the death of the Mai, and al-Kanemi, while still titular subject of the new Mai, had his own seals struck as Shehu of all Bornu.  The Shehu had constructed in 1814 a power base at the new city of Kukawa, and this became the de facto capitol of Bornu. Sayfawa mais remained titular monarchs after al-Kameni's 1836/7 death. In 1846 the last mai, in league with the Ouaddai Empire, precipitated a civil war, resisted by the Shehu and al-Kanemi's son, Umar. It was at that point that Umar (1837-1881) became sole ruler, thus ending one of the longest dynastic reigns in African history.</English>
