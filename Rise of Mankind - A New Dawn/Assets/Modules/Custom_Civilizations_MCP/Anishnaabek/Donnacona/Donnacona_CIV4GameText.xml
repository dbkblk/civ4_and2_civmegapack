		<English>[H1]Donnacona[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Chief of the Huron[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]c.1490-1539[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Chief Donnacona was the chief of Stadacona, a village located at the present site of Quebec City, Canada. Donnacona and his people were fishing off the Gaspé peninsula when French explorer Jacques Cartier first arrived there in 1534. Cartier persuaded him to let his two sons, Domagaya and Taignoagny, sail away with him, promising to bring them back. The French needed to train interpreters. They spent eight months there and sailed again with Cartier in May 1535. [PARAGRAPH:1]Cartier obtained from Donnacona, who claimed to have travelled a great deal, much information about the country and also about the fabulous kingdom of the Saguenay which could be reached by the river which bears that name today and where "there are immense quantities of gold, rubies and other rich things, and . . . the men there are white as in France and go clothed in woolens," along with many other "marvels too long to relate." [PARAGRAPH:1]A mutual distrust flared up in the spring of 1536. Donnacona absented himself mysteriously and returned with people who had never been seen before. Cartier sent him an embassy, but Donnacona refused to receive it. It was finally learned that a quarrel had broken out at Stadacona between Chief Donnacona and his rival Agona. The interpreter Taignoagny asked for Cartier's help to eliminate Agona. Cartier saw how he could turn the situation to good account and was "determined to outwit them." Since there was a crisis at Stadacona, it was better to get rid of Donnacona and his sons who were hindering the policy of the French. Cartier pretended therefore to join in the plot against Agona. The interpreters promised to come back the following day for the feast of the Holy Cross. Donnacona and his people arrived for the religious ceremony and were seized on an order from Cartier. [PARAGRAPH:1]Upon their arrival in France in July 1536, Chief Donnacona and his companions proceeded to live at the king's expense. Donnacona was presented to François I, and talked to him about mines which were very rich in gold and silver, of an abundance of cloves, nutmeg, and pepper (the spices of which Europe dreamed). He enumerated many marvels, such as men with wings on their arms like bats, who flew from the trees to the ground. Around 1539, Donnacona died. When Cartier returned in 1541, a  veritable war finally broke out between the natives of Stadacona and the colonists at Charlesbourg-Royal. The St. Lawrence Iroquois were to boast of killing more than 35 of Cartier's men in avenging Donnacona.</English>
