		<English>[H1]Cochise [\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Chief of the Chiricahua Apache [\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1805 - 1874[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB] Adatlichi, better known as 'Cochise' (meaning 'hardwood') was a chief of the Chokonen  band of the Chiricahua Apache and the leader of an uprising that began in 1861. Cochise was described as a large man (for the time), with a muscular frame, classical Roman features, and long black hair which he wore in traditional Apache style. [PARAGRAPH:1]Cochise and the Chokonen-Chiricahua lived in the area that is now the northern Mexican region of Sonora, and New Mexico and Arizona, which were traditional Apache territories until the coming of the Europeans. Due to encroachment by Spain and later Mexico, the Chokonen and Nednhi-Chiricahua became increasingly dependent upon food rations issued by the Mexican government to placate them. When this practice was abruptly ended in 1831, the various Chiricahua bands resumed raids to acquire food. Mexican troops were largely unsuccessful in their attempts to address this and were often fought to a standstill by the Apache. As part of their attempts at controlling the Chiricahua, Mexican forces, often with the help of American and Native American mercenaries, began to kill Apache civilians, including Cochise's father. Mexican forces were finally able to capture Cochise in 1848 during an Apache raid on Fronteras, Sonora, but they exchanged him for nearly a dozen Mexican hostages. [PARAGRAPH:1]At Apache Pass in 1862, Cochise and his father-in-law, Mangas Coloradas, with 500 fighters, held their ground against a force of 3,000 California volunteers under Carleton until howitzer artillery fire was brought to bear on their position. The impasse continued until both parties agreed to parley. During what was to be a peaceful parley session, the Americans took the unsuspecting Mangas Coloradas prisoner and then later executed him. This continued a series of incidents that fanned the flames of enmity between the encroaching Americans and the Apache. For Cochise, the Americans held nothing sacred and had violated the rules of war by capturing Mangas Coloradas during a parley session. Cochise and the Apache continued their raids against American and Mexican settlements and military positions throughout the 1860s. [PARAGRAPH:1]Following various skirmishes, Cochise and his men were gradually driven into the Dragoon Mountains but were nevertheless able to use the mountains as cover and as a base from which to continue significant skirmishes against white settlements. This was the situation until 1871 when General George Crook assumed command and used other Apaches as scouts and informants and was thereby able to force Cochise's men to surrender. Cochise was taken into custody in September of that year. The next year, the Chiricahua were ordered to Tularosa Reservation in New Mexico but refused to leave their ancestral lands in Arizona, which were guaranteed to them under treaty. Cochise managed to escape again and renewed raids and skirmishes against settlements through most of 1872. A new treaty was later negotiated by General Oliver O. Howard as the Americans relented to some of the Apaches' terms. Cochise quietly retired to an Arizona reservation, where he died of natural causes.</English>
