		<English>[H1]Amanishakheto[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Kandake of Nubia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c.20 BC - 20 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Amanishakheto (aka - Amanishabheto) was a kandake of Nubia. Kandake ('Candace' in English) was the title for female rulers of the ancient African state of Kush. The capital region of the Kushite empire was centered in Sudan, but the empire extended all through Africa and including Egypt. They formed a series of Nubian warrior queens, queens regnant, and queen mothers that ruled Kush in an unbroken line for over one thousand years. At an earlier period, men had ruled or shared rule with them. By the time of Emperor Augustus, documented accounts of solitary female rulers had emerged.[PARAGRAPH:1]Amanishakheto succeeded the Candace Amanirenas. She was Crown Princess for several years before she became Empress. When the Roman Emperor Augustus attempted to conquer Nubia, she fought the Roman Army in three battles from 24-21 BCE. When the Augustus attempted to tax the Kushites, she and her son Akinidad attacked a Roman fort in Egypt. The Romans eventually negotiated peace. She was succeeded by her daughter, Amanitore.[PARAGRAPH:1]She seems to have reigned from 10 BCE to 1 CE, although most dates of Nubian history before the Middle ages are very uncertain. Amanishakheto is known from several monuments. She is mentioned in the Amun-temple of Kawa, on a stela from Meroe, and in inscriptions of a palace building found at Wad ban Naqa, from a stela found at Qasr Ibrim, another stela from Naqa and her pyramid at Meroe. Her titles were Candace and later qore, which means king.[PARAGRAPH:1]Amanishakheto is best known from a treasure of jewellery recovered in 1834 from her pyramid in Meroe. These pieces are now in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin and Munich.</English>
