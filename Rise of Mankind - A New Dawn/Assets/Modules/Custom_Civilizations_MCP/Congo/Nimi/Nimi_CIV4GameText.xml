		<English>[H1]Lukeni lua Nimi[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Manikongos of Mbanza Kongo[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1380 - 1420 [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Lukeni lua Nimi (a.k.a Ntinu Nimi a Lukeni) was the first king and founder of the Kingdom of Kongo. The name Nimi a Lukeni appeared in later oral traditions and some modern historians, notably Jean Cuvelier, popularized it. Nimi became the founder of Kongo when, around 1400, he moved his capital to Mbanza Kongo on a mountain that lay to the south and was conquered from Mwene Kabunga (or Mwene Mpangala) whose descendants symbolically challenged the conquest annually two centuries later.[PARAGRAPH:1]He was the offpsring of his father Nimi and the Mwene Mbata's daughter, according to traditions recorded by Giovanni Cavazzi da Montecuccolo in the mid 17th century. Although he probably ruled in the valley of the Kwilu River in modern day Democratic Republic of Congo, he is credited with conquering the region of modern day Mbanza Kongo, displacing a localruler named Mwene Mpangala and building his capital there. He probably ruled in the late 14th century.[PARAGRAPH:1]In Jesuit-authored accounts, Lukeni lua Nimi is presented as a conqueror who came from the north, on the other side of the Congo River. In one account, he was the younger son of a king, unlikely to succeed to power after his father, and seeking a new kingdom of his own. In another account, he commits a dreadful double homicide, stabbing his pregnant mother through the womb; then, gathering his followers, who are encouraged rather than repelled by this gruesome murder, he conquers Kongo.[PARAGRAPH:1]People speaking ancient versions of Kikongo probably arrived in the region from the north as part of the larger Bantu migration. They were practicing agriculture by at least 1000 BC, and working iron by at least 400 BC.</English>
