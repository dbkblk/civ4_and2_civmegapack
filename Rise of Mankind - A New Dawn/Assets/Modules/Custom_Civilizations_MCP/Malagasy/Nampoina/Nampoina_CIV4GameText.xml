He succeeded his father Andriamiaramanjaka in 1787 and beginning in the 1790s, he began establishing control over the major part of the Madagascar island. He established civil and penal codes, distributed land, and reglemented commerce. [PARAGRAPH:1]While written accounts describe a state that was already well organised by the end of the 18th Century, a form of centralized political authority existed before that date. Nampoina expanded the Marina kingdom and the increased the slave trade from Madagascar to Mauritius and other lands. The slave trade provided weapons, and an expansion of the army, which also coincided with the development of literacy, provided by the Antaimoro people of Madagascar, who had retained some Arabic script. [PARAGRAPH:1]After succeeding in gathering all Imerina region kingdoms, Nampoina tackled challenges so as to nourish the whole population. Tools were given to peasants, markets were settled, he had dykes built so as to fit out Betsimitatatra ricefields plains. Thousands of peasants worked there. In order to encourage them and convey royal guidelines, Nampoina sent his best Mpikabary (orators), singers and dancers on building sites, roadworks and ricefields. [PARAGRAPH:1]All along the 19th century, the sovereigns of Imerina (the central Highlands of Madagascar) made it their business to extend their authority to the rest of the country. Various chiefs of clans, and later the princes of various regions, had fought to expand their territories, but the first deliberate effort to unify the country was undertaken by Nampoina. Probably due to the exceptional stature he had built for himself, his legacy acquired a sacredness that was used by all his successors to legitimise their authority. One outstanding part of that legacy was that he prescribed that royalty should be kept in the hands of his female relatives and their female descendants. Except for the transition he had accorded to his son Radama, women henceforth ruled in Madagascar: Ranavalona I (1828-1861), Rasoherina (1863-1868), Ranavalona II (1868-1883) and Ranavalona III (1883-1896). [PARAGRAPH:1]During the time of his reign, he introduced regulatory policies and structures of accountability by establishing a judicial code, banning alcohol, tobacco, and hemp, and devising a system of weights and measures. Public works projects were accomplished through a system of tributary labor, and laws were established to prevent the burning of rain forests.</English>
