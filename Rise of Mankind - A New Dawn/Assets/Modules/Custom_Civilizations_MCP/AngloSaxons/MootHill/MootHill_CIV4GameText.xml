		<English>A Moot hill is a hill or mound historically used as a meeting place. In early mediaeval Britain, such hills were used for moots, meetings of local people to settle local business. Among other things, proclamations might be read; decisions might be taken; court cases might be settled at a moot. Although some moot hills were naturally occurring features or had been created long before as burial mounds, others were purpose-built.</English>
