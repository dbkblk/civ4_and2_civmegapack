		<English>[TAB]Qat is a flowering plant native to tropical East Africa, grown for use as a stimulant for centuries in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Chewing khat predates the use of coffee and is used in a similar social context. Its fresh leaves and tops are chewed or, less frequently, dried and consumed as tea, in order to achieve a state of euphoria and stimulation. It is estimated that several million people are frequent users of qat.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Many of the users originate from countries between Sudan and Madagascar and in the southwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula, especially Yemen. In Yemen, a majority of people chew the plant daily for long periods of their life. The traditional form of qat chewing in Yemen involves only male users; qat chewing by females is less formal and less frequent. Despite it being outlawed in most Muslim countries, Yemeni clerics have adopted a lenient stance on its use.</English>
