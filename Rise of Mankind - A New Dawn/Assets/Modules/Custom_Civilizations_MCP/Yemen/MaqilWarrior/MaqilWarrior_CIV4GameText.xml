		<English>[TAB]The people of the Western Sahara are descended from two known tribes that were the original inhabitants of the territory: the Zenata and the Sanhaja. Beginning in the seventh century, they resisted the invasion of Muslim Arab peoples from the east, but they accepted Islam. Under the influence of Islam, the first unified movement of the population was created, resulting in the establishment of the Almoravid dynasty. At the end of the 13th century, Arab Yeminite people, known as Maqil, invaded the Western Sahara and created a new political and social culture. The Mauritanian Thirty-Year War (1644-74) was the unsuccessful final effort to repel the Yemeni Maqil Arab invaders led by the Beni Hassan tribe. The descendants of the Yemeni Beni Hassan warriors became the upper stratum of Moorish society.</English>
