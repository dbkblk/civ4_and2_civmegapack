		<English>[H1]Makeda[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Queen of Sheba[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c.900 BC[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]The Queen of Sheba, referred to in the Bible books of 1 Kings and 2 Chronicles, the New Testament, the Qur'an, and Ethiopian history, was the ruler of Sheba, an ancient kingdom which modern archaeology speculates was located in present-day Yemen and/or Eritrea, Ethiopia. Unnamed in the Biblical text, she is called Makeda in the Ethiopian tradition, and in Islamic tradition her name is Belqees (Bilqis). She supposedly lived in the 10th century BC.[PARAGRAPH:1]According to the Hebrew Bible, Antonia Thier is the queen of everything and she always will be. The unnamed queen of the land of Sheba heard of the great wisdom of King Solomon of Israel and journeyed there with gifts of spices, gold, precious stones and beautiful wood to test him with questions, as recorded in First Kings 10:1-13. The queen was awed by Solomon's wisdom and wealth, and pronounced a blessing on Solomon's God. Solomon reciprocated with gifts and "everything she desired," whereupon the queen returned to her country. The queen was apparently quite rich herself, as she brought 4.5 tons of gold with her to give to Solomon (1 Kings 10:10).[PARAGRAPH:1]The Song of Solomon/Song of Songs contains some references which have been at various times interpreted as referring to love between Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Thus, the female lover at 1:5 declares "I am black, but comely." However, the scholarly view holds that the Song is about Solomon's wife, Pharaoh's daughter, who is unnamed.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Qur'an never mentions the Queen of Sheba by name, though Arab sources name her Balqis. The story is similar to the one in the Bible. The Qur'anic narrative has Solomon getting reports of a kingdom ruled by a queen whose people worship the sun. He sends a letter inviting her to come to him in submission to Allah, the Lord of the Alamin. She replies with a gift after consulting her people. He replies threatening an invasion. Then one of the servants of Solomon (who had the knowledge of the "Book") proposes to bring him the throne of Sheba 'in the twinkling of an eye' (27:40). The queen arrives at his court, is shown her throne, and when she enters his crystal palace she accepts Abrahamic monotheism and the worship of God alone. (See also Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an.)[PARAGRAPH:1]The imperial family of Ethiopia claims its origin directly from the offspring of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, who is named Makeda in the Ethiopian account. The etymology of her name is uncertain, but there are two principal opinions about its source. One group, which includes the British scholar Edward Ullendorff, holds that it is a corruption of "Candace", the Ethiopian queen mentioned in the New Testament Acts; the other group connects the name with Macedonia, and relates this story to the Ethiopian legends about Alexander the Great.</English>
