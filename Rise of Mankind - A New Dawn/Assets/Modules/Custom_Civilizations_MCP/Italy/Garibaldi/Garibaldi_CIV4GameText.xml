An unflagging foe of all tyranny, he devoted his life to fighting oppression.[PARAGRAPH:1]For the greater part of his life most of the native land of Giuseppe Garibaldi was under the control of foreigners. In the north Lombardy was held by Austria, and to the south of the States of the Church the kingdom of Naples was in the hands of the stagnant feudal regime of the Bourbons. Garibaldi was the embodiment of the Italian brand of 19th-century nationalism, which was impelled by the twin desires for unity and freedom.[PARAGRAPH:1]An Italian patriot, Garibaldi began life as a sailor. He associated himself enthusiastically with Mazzini for the liberation of his country, but being convicted of conspiracy, fled to South America where, as both a privateer and a soldier, he gave his services to the young republics struggling there for life. Returning to Europe, Garibaldi took part in the defense of Rome against France. Being defeated, he fled to New York to return to the Isle of Caprera, biding his time. He joined the Piedmontese against Austria and, in 1860, set himself to assist in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Naples and the union of Italy under Victor Emmanuel. Landing in Calabria, Garibaldi entered Naples and drove the royal forces before him without striking a blow, after which he returned to his retreat at Caprera, ready still to draw sword, and occasionally offering it again in the cause of republicanism. Garibaldi died in 1882.</English>
