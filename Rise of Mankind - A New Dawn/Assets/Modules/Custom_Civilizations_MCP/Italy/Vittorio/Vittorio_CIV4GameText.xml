		<English>[H1]Vittorio Emanuele II [\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]First King of Italy [\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] March 14, 1820 - January 9, 1878 AD[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Vittorio Emanuele II was born in Turin. During the reign of his father, Carlo Alberto, the kingdoms of Sardinia and Piedmont were united. Carlo Alberto went to war in 1848 against the Austrian Empire (which ruled most of northern Italy), but was defeated at the Battle of Novara the following year. Carlo Alberto abdicated and Vittorio Emanuele II became king of Sardinia and Piedmont on March 24, 1849. Under his command, and with the skillful action of his minister, Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, the Kingdom of Sardinia grew to include whole Italy (1860 - 1870).  And so, through the process of Italian Unification, Vittorio Emmanuele II of Savoy became Vittorio Emmanuele II of Italy. Vittorio Emmanuele would keep the former ordinal number though he became the first king of Italy, in order to maintain the dynastical continuity.</English>
