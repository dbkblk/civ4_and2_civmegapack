		<English>[H1]Ostenaco[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Leader of the Cherokee[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Campaign Dates: 1754-1758 [\BOLD][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]During the French and Indian War Ostenaco was a leader of Cherokee warriors who assisted Virginia military leaders against northern tribes allied to the French. His leadership provided a much-needed Indian alliance for the British colonial settlements in much of present day West Virginia and beyond. Ostenaco led the fight against Ohio Valley Indians who were allied with the French and attacking settlements in the areas of the Tygart Valley, Greenbrier River, and North and South Branches of the Potomac River. With Major Andrew Lewis he led an expedition against the Shawnee along the Big Sandy River area that ended in failure but forged a lasting friendship with Lewis. His allegiance with such Virginia leaders contributed significantly to the expansion of English-speaking peoples into what is now West Virginia.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ostenaco was famous in Cherokee society for his military achievement as well as his diplomacy. His war title was Outacite or Man-Killer. During the French and Indian War (1754 - 1763), fought for control of North American trade and land, the Cherokee allied themselves with the British against the French and their Northern Indian allies. However conflict between the Cherokee and British followed with the siege on Fort Loudoun in East Tennessee. Ostenaco, the great orator, eventually made peace with a representative of colonial Virginia, Henry Timberlake, who visited for several months. Timberlake then took him and two other chiefs to visit London and King George III.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1754, the first shots in the bloody 7 year brawl known today as the French and Indian War were fired. The war embroiled several North American nations in a struggle for control of the eastern third of the continent. In the summer of 1755, English General Edward Braddock alienated Ohio Valley Iroquois, Delaware, and Shawnee allies and reaped a just reward by losing soundly to a numerically inferior army of Indians and Frenchmen near the forks of Ohio River.[PARAGRAPH:1]This loss unleashed the fury of French and Amerindian warriors against the English colonists in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. The colonies requested assistance from southern Amerindians, traditional enemies of the northerners, and the response from the Cherokees was swift and strong. Mankiller Ostenaco led 130 warriors against the Shawnees in the winter of 1756. The Cherokee campaign failed by the addition of a slow-moving, hunger-ridden, infighting Virginian army. However, a strong friendship between Mankiller Ostenaco and Mjr. Andrew Lewis ensured the steady support the colonies needed from the Cherokees.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ostenaco recruited warriors, led war parties, and conducted diplomatic missions. His efforts ensured that the colonies defensive war was complemented by effective offensive maneuvers carried to the very gates of the enemy's Ohio Valley strongholds. The Cherokee offensive campaign paved the way for the Reverand Post's peace mission to the Ohio Valley Indians, and this led to the relatively unopposed march of General Forbes army to the ruins of Fort Duquesne (present-day Pittsburgh) late in 1758.</English>
