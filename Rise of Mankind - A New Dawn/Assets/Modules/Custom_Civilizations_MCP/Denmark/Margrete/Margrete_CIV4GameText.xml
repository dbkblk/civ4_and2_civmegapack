		<English>[H1]Margrete I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Queen of Denmark, Norway and Sweden[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1353 - October 28, 1412 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Margaret of Denmark is perhaps the most underrated monarch Denmark has ever had.  To call Margaret of Denmark the Queen of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway is inaccurate because with the exception of Sweden, where she was married to Swedish King Haakon VI in 1363, she was only a regent to these countries. She in effect, ruled under her son's name, Olaf, until his death at the age of 17 in 1387. Although being a regent to these countries her accomplishments were many, first she continued the reconstruction of the country, which her father Valdemar IV had stated, she strengthened the unification between Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, and lastly she took an active role in shaping Denmark's future in European politics. With so many accomplishments, Margaret is over shadowed by the unfortunate timing of her death in Flensburg, Germany on October, 1412. Her death is significant because it is listed as unknown; it could have been accidental, natural causes, or even murder.[PARAGRAPH:1]She is known in Denmark as "Margrete I", to distinguish her from the current queen, but she never (except for a brief period in 1375) actually styled herself Queen of Denmark; rather she called herself "Margrete, by the grace of God, Valdemar Daneking's daughter" and "Denmark's rightful heir" when referring to her rulership in Denmark. Others simply referred to her as the "Lady Queen" without specifying what she was queen (or female king) of, but not so Pope Boniface IX, who blatantly styled her "Queen of Denmark" or "Queen of Denmark, Norway and Sweden" in his letters.[PARAGRAPH:1]Margaret's rule started in 1375, after her Valdemar IV's death in 1375. Her first political act was to install her son as the elected king of Denmark in 1375. Having ruled in her father's name, then later in her son's name, Margaret was granted title of Regent of Norway and Denmark in 1380.  Although her son died seven years later in 1387, Margaret through her superior statesmanship, political power, and sheer likeability, remained the ruler of all three nations. As a testament to her great political power, Margaret was able to bring the Swedish crown under her rule when she convinced the Swedes to expel King Albert in 1386 and elect Margaret's son Olaf to the throne.[PARAGRAPH:1]Under Margaret's reign Norway, Denmark, and Sweden all enjoyed new levels of political, social, and military peace. Margaret exercised her power to end wars in her countries. During her reign Margaret order the destruction of private castles, prohibited private warfare, strengthened the royal through using the royal court system.  Margaret also strengthened relations with the Catholic Church by donating large grants of money to the institution after she came to power. Margaret could not rule in her own power for long, because of her gender, so she appointed her 8 year old nephew, Eric of Pomerania king of Norway, Sweden and Denmark in 1389.  This was a smart move because picking such a young king allowed her to rule in his name until he came of age in 1401. Despite Eric age, Margaret continued to rule these three countries until her own death.[PARAGRAPH:1]The reforms and social programs which Valdemar IV started in the late fourteenth century carried over to prosper during Margaret's reign.  Margaret did much to improve Denmark's social, economic, and political standing in Europe.  At her death, however, the importance of her rule would wear off when Norway and Sweden break away from the crown. Sweden would leave the arraignment in 1439 and Norway would leave in 1442 over political and social disagreements as well as a weak King, Margaret's son. Although Margaret was a very astute ruler, able to get her children elected king in three countries, she is often overshadowed in importance in Danish history. Furthermore, controversy surrounds her death aboard a ship traveling to Flensburg, Germany.  Her death could have been of natural causes, but that would have been unlikely because she was physically active up till her death.  Furthermore, much is written about her political career, but almost nothing is known about her personal life.  The most significant controversy surrounding Margaret's life was her death.  It is yet to be proven that she was not murdered by political enemies or zealots.[PARAGRAPH:1]</English>
