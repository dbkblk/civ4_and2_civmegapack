		<English>[H1]Tomas Masaryk[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President of Czechoslovakia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1859 - 1937[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Masaryk was born to a working-class family in the predominantly Catholic city of Hodonin, Moravia. This was then in the Austrian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and is now in the Czech Republic. His father Jozef Masaryk, a carter, was a Slovak from the Hungarian part of Austria-Hungary (nowadays Slovakia), and his mother Terezie Masarykova was from Moravia.[PARAGRAPH:1]Masaryk served in the Reichsrat (Austrian Parliament) from 1891 to 1893 in the Young Czech Party and again from 1907 to 1914 in the Realist Party, but he did not campaign for Czech independence from Austria-Hungary. When the First World War broke out, he had to flee the country to avoid arrest for treason, going to Geneva, to Italy, and then to England, where he started to agitate for Czech independence. He became Professor of Slav Research at King's College in London lecturing on "The problem of small peoples". In 1916 he went to France to convince the French government of the necessity of disintegrating Austria-Hungary. After the February Revolution in 1917 he proceeded to Russia to help organize Slavic resistance to the Austrians, so-called Czechoslovak Legions. In 1918 he travelled to the United States, where he convinced President Woodrow Wilson of the rightness of his cause. On October 18, 1918, Masaryk, standing on the steps of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, proclaimed Czechoslovakia's independence.[PARAGRAPH:1]Masaryk as a philosopher was an outspoken rationalist and humanist. He emphasised practical ethics, reflecting the influence of Anglo-Saxon philosophers, French philsophy, and especially the work of 18th Century German philsopher, Herder, the so-called founder of nationalism. He was critical of German idealistic philosophy and Marxism. Although born Catholic, he eventually became a non-practicing Protestant, influenced in part by the declaration of Papal Infallibiliy in 1870 and his wife, Charlotte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Masaryk died from natural causes in 1937 at the age of 87, in Lany, Czechoslovakia, now Czech Republic.</English>
