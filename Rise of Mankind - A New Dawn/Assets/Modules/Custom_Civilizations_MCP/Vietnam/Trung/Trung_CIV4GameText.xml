		<English>[H1]Trung Trac[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Queen of Vietnam[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: c.12 - 43 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]The Trung Sisters, known in Vietnamese as Hai Ba Trung (the two Trung ladies), were regarded as national heroines of Vietnam after they successfully repelled Chinese invasions for three years. The sisters were known as Trung Trac and Trung Nhi and were born during the thousand-year Chinese occupation of Vietnam. The dates of their birth are unknown, but Trrung Trac was older than Trung Nhi. The exact date of their death is unknown but they both died in the year AD 43.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Trung sisters were born in a rural Vietnamese village, into a military family. Their father was a prefect of Me Linh, therefore the sisters grew up in a house well-versed in the martial arts. They also witnessed the cruel treatment of the Viets by their Chinese overlords. The Trung sisters spent much time studying the art of warfare, as well as learning fighting skills.[PARAGRAPH:1]In AD 39 Trung Trac and Trung Nhi, after successfully repelling a small Chinese unit from their village, assembled a large army, consisting mostly of women. Within months, they had taken back many (about 65) citadels from the Chinese, and had liberated much of Vietnam. They became queens of the country, and managed to resist all Chinese attacks on Vietnam for over two years.[PARAGRAPH:1]Their revolution was short lived however, as the Chinese gathered a huge expeditionary army to crush the native fighters. Legend has it that the Chinese army did this by going into battle unclothed. The enemy's brazenness so shamed the Vietnamese female warriors that they fled the battle scene, leaving the weakened forces easily defeated by the Chinese.[PARAGRAPH:1]Despite the many heroic efforts, the Trung sisters realised that they had been defeated and that to fight further would mean death at the hands of the Chinese. Therefore to protect their honour, and to elude ridicule, the two queens committed suicide by drowning themselves in the Hat River (AD 43).[PARAGRAPH:1]The Trung Sisters are highly revered in Vietnam, as they led the first resistance movement against the occupying Chinese after 247 years of domination. Many temples are dedicated to them, and a yearly holiday, occurring in February, to commemorate their deaths is observed by many Vietnamese. A district in Hanoi is named after them. In addition, numerous large streets in major cities are named after them. They are often depicted riding on elephants into battle.  </English>
