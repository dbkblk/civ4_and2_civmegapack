		<English>[H1]Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President of Venezuela  [\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD]July 28, 1954 - Present[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias is the current President of Venezuela. As the leader of the Bolivarian Revolution, Chavez promotes a political doctrine of democratic socialism and Latin American integration. He is also a critic of neoliberalism, globalization and United States foreign policy. A career military officer, Chavez founded the left-wing Fifth Republic Movement after orchestrating a failed 1992 coup d'etat against former President Carlos Andres Perez. Chavez was elected President in 1998 with a campaign centering on promises of aiding Venezuela's poor majority, and was reelected in 2000 and in 2006. Domestically, Chavez has maintained nation wide Bolivarian Missions, whose goals are to combat disease, illiteracy, malnutrition, poverty, and other social ills. Abroad, Ch競ez has acted against the Washington Consensus by supporting alternative models of economic development, and has advocated cooperation among the world's poor nations, especially those in Latin America.

	Chavez's policies have evoked controversy in Venezuela and abroad, receiving anything from vehement criticism to enthusiastic support. The government of the United States claims that Chavez is a threat to democracy in Latin America. Others sympathize with his ideology or welcome his bilateral trade and reciprocal aid agreements. In 2005 and 2006 he was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people. After a two-year imprisonment, Chavez was pardoned by President Rafael Caldera in 1994. Upon his release, Chavez reconstituted the MBR-200 as the Fifth Republic Movement (MVR듌ovimiento Quinta Republica, with the V representing the Roman numeral five). Later, in 1998, Chavez began to campaign for the presidency. In working to earn the trust of voters, Chavez drafted an agenda that drew heavily on his ideology of Bolivarianism. Chavez and his followers described their aim as "laying the foundations of a new republic" to replace the existing one, which they cast as "party-dominated"; the current constitution, they argued, was no more than the 'juridico-political embodiment of puntofijismo,' the country's traditional two-party patronage system.

	Chavez utilized his flamboyant public speaking style, which was noted for its abundance of colloquialisms and ribald manner듪n the campaign trail to win the trust and favour of a primarily poor and working class following. By May 1998, Chavez's support had risen to 30% in polls, and by August he was registering 39%. Chavez went on to win the 1998 presidential election on December 6, 1998 with 56% of the votes. Chavez was sworn in as president on February 2, 1999. Among his first acts was the launching of Plan Bolivar 2000, which included road building, housing construction, and mass vaccination. Chavez also halted planned privatizations of, among others, the national social security system, aluminum industry holdings, and the oil sector.[26] Chavez also overhauled the formerly lax tax collection and auditing system든specially regarding major corporations and landholders.

	Responding to the stalling of his legislation in the National Assembly, Chavez scheduled two national elections for July 1999, including a referendum for and elections to fill a new constitutional assembly. The Constitutional Assembly was created when the referendum passed with a 72% "yes" vote, while the pro-Ch競ez Polo Patriotico ("Patriotic Pole") won 95% (120 of the total 131) of its seats. In August 1999, the Constitutional Assembly's "Judicial Emergency Committee" declared a "legislative emergency" whereby a seven-member committee conducted the National Assembly's functions; meanwhile, the National Assembly was prohibited from holding meetings. The Constitutional Assembly drafted the 1999 Venezuelan Constitution, which included an increase in the presidential term from five to six years, a new presidential two-term limit, a new provision for presidential recall elections, renaming of the country to Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela, expanded presidential powers, conversion of the bicameral National Assembly into a unicameral legislature, merit-based appointments of judges, and creation of the Public Defender, an office authorized to regulate the activities of the presidency and the National Assembly.

	In December 1999, the new constitution was approved. On December 15, after weeks of heavy rain, statewide mudslides claimed the lives of an estimated 30,000 people. Critics claim Chavez was distracted by the referendum and that the government ignored a civil defense report, calling for emergency measures, issued the day the floods struck. The government rejected these claims. Chavez personally led the relief effort afterwards. With respect to domestic policies, critics claim that both corruption and crime are rampant. They also cite a failing infrastructure and public hospitals. Criticism from Chavez supporters arises from reports that Chavez is not fulfilling his major campaign pledges with respect to labor and land reform. Critics charged that the Ch競ez government has engaged in "gigantic fraud" during the 2004 recall referendum, though all international observers and exit polls confirmed the official result. The United States government claims that his cooperation in their war on terror is negligible or purposely indifferent with regards to the FARC and ELN, who are engaged in a conflict with the US-backed Colombian government; nonetheless, the US government says there is no evidence of a direct link between violent groups opposed to its policies and Chavez.

	Several public figures have even gone so far as to call for the assassination of Chavez, most notably US Conservative Christian televangelist Pat Robertson. Other such requests have been expressed by Venezuelan actor Orlando Urdaneta and former president of Venezuela Carlos Andres Perez. The US Ambassador to Venezuela between 2001 and 2004, Charles Shapiro, also reported to the Chavez administration two potential assassination plots. Chavez has been accused of concentrating power of judicial and legislative branches. The leading business daily of Argentina, Ambito Financiero, predicted that Venezuela under Chavez in 2007 would have a "nationalized economy, out-of-control spending, government by decree, and perpetual re-election." The motion which included the provision to allow indefinite presidential re-election was voted down in national referendum in 2007. The daily also compared Chavez to King Louis XIV of France, stating his 2007 inauguration would mark "a concentration of power without precedent in Venezuela."
