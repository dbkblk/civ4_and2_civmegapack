		<English>[H1]Po Ngbe [\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of the Olmec[\BOLD][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Between 900-600 BC one of the major rulers at Guerrero was Po Ngbe. There is also an important tablet from Ahuelican, Guerrero of mottled green stone that also mentions King Po Ngbe, and his building of a great temple at his site.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Guerrero celt makes it clear that Po Ngbe was recognized as a member of the craftsmen caste. He was ruler of the place where these artifacts were found. This celt also makes it clear that Po Ngbe was probably buried in a pyramid. This view is supported by the Ahuelican, Guerrero Tablet. This artifact was made of the same stone as the Teo mask and the Guerrero celt. Recently a mask of Po Ngbe was recently discovered and published. The mask of Po Ngbe has an inscription written on the inside of the mask.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the first column of the Teo Mask inscription we read the following:[PARAGRAPH:2]"Cause (here) the conferring of all virtue to this very good abode. Admiration indeed (Oh) Governor. Indeed (you are) wonder. Thou (art) a spirit of tranquility . (Thou art like) the Jaguar (a master of the bush). Righteousness takes root here in this tomb of Na Po Ngbe. This habitation of the devotee (is) a habitation of propriety. Order (Na Po Ngbe) this object of respect to be an envoy on a mission (to) hold upright purity. He who is a powerful spirit (in) thine tomb. Righteousness takes root here (in your) tomb. [Na Po Ngbe] A boundless source of great spiritual tranquility (your) abode. The tomb is powerful. lay low (the celebrity) [in the tomb] to realize spiritual tranquility."</English>
