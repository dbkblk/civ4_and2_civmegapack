Prior to becoming president, Ahmadinejad served as mayor of Tehran, a governor of Kurdistan, Ardabil, and served in the Iran-Iraq War, as a member of Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution. He is the highest directly elected official in the country; constitutionally, he has much less power than the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces of Iran and has the final word in all aspects of foreign and domestic policies.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ahmadinejad is a critic of the George W. Bush Administration and supports strengthened relations with Russia, Venezuela, Syria, and the Persian Gulf states. He has said Iran's nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and has refused to end enrichment despite United Nations Security Council resolutions.[PARAGRAPH:1]He has called for the dissolution of the state of Israel and its government, which he does not regard as legitimate or representative of the population,and for free elections in the region. He believes that the Palestinians need a stronger voice in the region's future. One of his most controversial statements was one in which, according to some translations, he called for Israel to be "wiped off the map," but interpretations of this statement vary widely. He has also been condemned for describing the Holocaust as a myth, which has led to accusations of anti-semitism. In response to these criticisms, Ahmadinejad said, "No, I am not anti-Jew, I respect them very much."[PARAGRAPH:1]During his presidency, Ahmadinejad launched a gas rationing plan to reduce the country's fuel consumption and cut the interest rate for private and public banking facilities.</English>
