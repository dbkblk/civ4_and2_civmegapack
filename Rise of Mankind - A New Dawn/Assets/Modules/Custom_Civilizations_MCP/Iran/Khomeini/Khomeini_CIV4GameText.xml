Following the revolution and a national referendum, Khomeini became the country's Supreme Leader, a position created in the constitution as the highest ranking political and religious authority of the nation, until his death.[PARAGRAPH:1]Khomeini was a marja or marja al-taqlid ("source of emulation") or Grand Ayatollah in Twelver Shi'a Islam, but is most famous for his political role. In his writings and preachings he expanded the Shi'a Usuli theory of velayat-e faqih, the "guardianship of the jurisconsult (clerical authority)" to include theocratic political rule by Islamic jurists and to provide the theological basis for his rule of Iran.[PARAGRAPH:1]Beloved by millions of Iranians, Khomeini was a "charismatic leader of immense popularity," and both his return from exile and his funeral were occasions of great emotional outpouring for millions. Abroad he was known for his support of the hostage takers during the Iranian hostage crisis and his fatwa calling for the death of British suject and writer Salman Rushdie. The "virtual face of Islam in Western popular culture," Khomeini was named Man of the Year in 1979 by TIME magazine, and became known outside of his supporters as a "fanatic whose judgments are harsh, reasoning bizarre, and conclusions surreal" who "inculcated fear and distrust towards Islam" during his reign.[PARAGRAPH:1]Khomeini is usually known as "Imam Khomeini" inside Iran and "Ayatollah Khomeini" outside of Iran.</English>
