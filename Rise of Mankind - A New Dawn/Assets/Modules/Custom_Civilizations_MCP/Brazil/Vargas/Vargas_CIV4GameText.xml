		<English>[H1]Getúlio Dornelles Vargas[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President and Dictator of Brazil[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1882 - 1954[PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Vargas was a gaúcho, from the southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul, deeply divided in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by bloody civil war, from which emerged a centralist political system, influenced by positivism. Vargas helped to unite two of his state's most important political clans, becoming President of Rio Grande do Sul, then Minister of Finance in the federal government. He was already a seasoned politician, cautious, conciliatory, and with a strong dislike of conflict and confrontation, when he became President of Brazil, following the revolution of 3 October 1930. Vargas now drew on the centralizing tradition of his native state, supported by military leaders and industrialists, to weld  the loose federation of the "Old Republic" (1889 – 30) into a centralized state, with a stronger federal army, a stronger civil service and greatly enlarged social and economic powers and responsibilities. He confronted São Paulo in a civil war in 1932, defused other political opposition, from left and right, and pushed through political and social change under the corporatist constitution of the Estado Novo, 1937 to 1945.

In this process, he sought to break Brazil's economic dependence, however lucrative, on coffee and a handful of other primary products. He introduced measures for industrialization, including state control of the new steel industry, and sought to create a new industrial working class under corporatist controls, but protected, at least in law, by a detailed system of social and labour legislation, well in advance of its time. After Brazil entered the Second World War on the Allies' side, there was increased opposition to Vargas's corporatism, which he recognized by creating two political parties, the PTB (the Brazilian Labour Party), and the PSD (the Social Democratic Party), the first drawing on working-class support through the Ministry of Labour, the second largely on rural clientelism. He especially cultivated the urban working class and promised free elections, but was forced out of office in 1945 by united civilian and military opposition.

Vargas was elected as President in 1950 and committed himself to a programme of trabalhismo, namely, concerned with and for organized labour. This introduced, then increased, a minimum wage, offered wider social reforms, and sought to protect the national economy from what was perceived as an illegitimate degree of foreign intervention. Vargas's enemies on the right, in alliance with some leaders of the armed forces, partly inspired by Cold War ideology, accused him of "populism" and wishing to follow a political trajectory similar to that of Perón in Argentina. Under extreme pressure, Vargas shot himself on 24 August 1954.

Vargas remains an enigmatic figure, a supreme conciliatory politician, who died in political conflict, a social reformer, who imposed authoritarian controls, but was democratically elected with passionate popular support. The political tradition he introduced was inherited by President Kubitschek (1956 – 61), especially in promoting industrialization and infrastructure investment. The coup of 1964 and the subsequent military-backed regime (1964 – 85) were largely a reaction to Vargas and his policies. The key issues raised in his second period of government are still central to Brazilian political debate.</English>
