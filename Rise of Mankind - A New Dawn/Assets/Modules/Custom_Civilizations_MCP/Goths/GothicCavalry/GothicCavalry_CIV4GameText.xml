		<English>[TAB]The goths fought primarly on foot, but unlike other germanic tribes they also employed a large amount of heavy cavalry. The effectiveness of the Gothic heavy-cavalry was substantially heightened by their (innovative in Europe) use of stirrups. Particularly for heavy cavalry, this allows the use of heavier weapons and more cumbersome, but effective armour. Cavalry now had the ability to make head-on attacks on massed infantry, ie the "shock-troops" function of cavalry. They are also less likely to be dismounted at the first charge. The advantages of those improvements were one of the most important reasons for gothic victory at Adrianople (August 9, 378), the worst roman defeat since Battle of Cannae (216 BC). It showed weakness of roman army and led to sack of Rome by Visigoths in 410, first since Gallic invasion in 390 BC. Eventually it led to the fall of Western Empire and influenced change of Eastern Empire into Byzantium, with a switch from haevy infantry to heavy cavalry as the main part of the army.</English>
