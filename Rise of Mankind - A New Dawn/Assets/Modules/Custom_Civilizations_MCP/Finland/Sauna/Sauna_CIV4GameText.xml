		<English>[TAB]Historical evidence and records indicate that the Finns built the first wooden saunas over 2000 years ago. The early Finnish sauna was dug into a hill or embankment. As tools and techniques advanced, they were later built above ground using wooden logs. Rocks were heated in a stone fireplace with a wood fire. The smoke from the fire filled the room as the air warmed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once the temperature reached desired levels, the smoke was allowed to clear and the bathers entered. The wood smoke aroma still lingered and was part of the cleansing ritual. This type of traditional smoke sauna was called a savusauna, which means smoke sauna in Finnish. The smell of smoke and wood is relaxing to most people, especially those who have never been to sauna before. As the home of the sauna, Finnish sauna culture is well established, and plays an ongoing role in the central social structure.</English>
