		<English>[H1]Urho Kekkonen[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President of Finland[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1900 - 1986[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Urho Kaleva Kekkonen was a Finnish politician who served as Prime Minister of Finland and later as President of Finland. Kekkonen continued the "active neutrality" policy of President Juho Kusti Paasikivi, which came to be known as the Paasikivi-Kekkonen Line. This policy allowed Finland to live with both the nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Warsaw Pact. Kekkonen was the longest-serving president of Finland.[PARAGRAPH:1]Throughout his time as president, Kekkonen did his best to keep political rivals in check. The Centre Party's rival, National Coalition Party was kept in opposition despite good performance in elections. On a few occasions, the parliament was dissolved as the political composition did not please Kekkonen. Too prominent Centre Party members often found themselves sidelined, as Kekkonen negotiated directly with the lower lever. The "Mill Letters" of Kekkonen were a continuous stream of directives to high officials, politicians, journalists etc.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the 1960s Kekkonen was responsible for a number of foreign-policy initiatives, involving for example the Nordic nuclear-free zone, the border agreement with Norway and a Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in 1969. The purpose of these initiatives was to avoid the enforcement of the military articles in the FCMA treaty - in other words, military co-operation between Finland and the Soviet Union - and thus to strengthen Finland's attempt to practice a policy of neutrality. Following the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 pressure for neutrality increased. Kekkonen informed the Soviets in 1970 that he would not continue as president, nor would the FCMA treaty be extended, if the Soviet Union was no longer prepared to recognise Finland's neutrality.[PARAGRAPH:1]Kekkonen was re-elected normally in 1968. In 1973, he was re-elected by emergency law which saw his presidency extended by four years. The elimination of any significant opposition and competition meant de facto political autocracy for Kekkonen. The year 1975 can be regarded as marking the zenith of his power, when he dissolved parliament and hosted the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in Helsinki with the assistance of a caretaker government. In the 1978 Presidential election, with Kekkonen's candidacy being supported by the Social Democratic, Centre and National Coalition parties, there were no serious rivals left. Kekkonen won 259 out of the 300 electoral college votes, with his nearest rival, Raino Westerholm of the Christian Union. receiving 24.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1979 Urho Kekkonen was awarded Lenin Peace Prize. In 1981, Kekkonen begun to suffer from an undisclosed disease that seemed to affect his brain functions. In the same year, Prime Minister Mauno Koivisto had already defied Kekkonen and he still refused to resign. In September, Kekkonen left for sick leave, and in October he resigned. There is no public report about his illness.[PARAGRAPH:1]Kekkonen died at Tamminiemi in 1986 and was buried with full honors.</English>
