		<English>[TAB]Tacitus described the Batavians as the bravest of the tribes in the area, hardened in the German wars, with cohorts under their own commanders transferred to Britannia.  They retained the honor of the ancient association with the Romans, not required to pay tribute or taxes and used by the Romans only for war: "They furinished the Empire nothing but men and arms", Tacitus remarked,  Well-regarded for their skills in horsemanship and swimming - for men and horses could cross the Rhine without losing formation, according to Tacitus.[NEWLINE][TAB]The Alae Miliaria was the cavalry arm of the Batavian Cohorts supplied to the Romans.  The Miliaria would be used to flank and enemy and pepper them with pila (Roman javelins) before closing in a full charge.  These men were superb horsemen and could cross rivers and streams in full battle armor without loosing formation.  An excellent example of this skill is best described by Dio Cassius as he refers to the Battle of the River Medway."The barbarians thought that Romans would not be able to cross it without a bridge, and consequently bivouacked in rather careless fashion on the opposite bank; but he sent across a detachment of Germans, who were accustomed to swim easily in full armor across the most turbulent streams.  Thence the Britons retired to the river Thames at a point near where it empties into the ocean and at flood-tide forms a lake. This they easily crossed because they knew where the firm ground and the easy passages in this region were to be found; but the Romans in attempting to follow them were not so successful. However, the Germans swam across again and some others got over by a bridge a little way up-stream, after which they assailed the barbarians from several sides at once and cut down many of them." (Cassius Dio, Roman History, Book 60:20)[NEWLINE][TAB]Batavians also supplied large numbers of horsemen for the Emperor's Imperial Horse Guard.</English>
