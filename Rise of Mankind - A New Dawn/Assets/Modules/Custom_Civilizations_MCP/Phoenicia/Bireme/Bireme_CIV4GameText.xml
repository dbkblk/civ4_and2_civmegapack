		<English>[TAB]The bireme was introduced by the Phoenicians around 800 BC and became the leading warship of the Mediterranean world in the centuries to follow.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Phoenicians were astute naval architects. They lowered the platforms where the oarsmen were seated (crinolines) to increase vessel stability. The battering ram was covered in bronze. The decorative poop was bent and resembled the tail of a scorpion. The balustrade of the battle platform was covered with the shields of warriors, the bireme was thus partially covered in a primitive 'armor'. These war biremes were typically 30 meters in length and 5 meters wide. Phoenicians were the finest seamen of their time, and were often employed as mercenaries.</English>
