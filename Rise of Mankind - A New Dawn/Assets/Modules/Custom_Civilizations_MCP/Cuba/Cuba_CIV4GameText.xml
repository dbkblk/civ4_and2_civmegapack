		<English>[TAB] Cuba is the most populous nation in the Caribbean. Its people, culture and customs draw from several sources including the aboriginal peoples, the period of Spanish colonialism, African slaves, and its proximity to the United States. The recorded history of Cuba began on 17 October 1492, when Christopher Columbus sighted the island during his first voyage and claimed it for Spain. The island had been inhabited by Native American peoples known as the Taíno and Ciboney whose ancestors had come from South America and possibly North and Central America in a complex series of migrations perhaps 6,000 to 8,000 years ago. The Spanish oppressed and enslaved the approximately 100,000 indigenous people that resisted conversion to Christianity on the island. Within a century, they had all but disappeared as a result of the combined effects of European-introduced disease, forced labor and other mistreatment. Cuba was in a Spanish possession for almost 400 years (circa 1511-1898). The economy was based on plantation agriculture and mining, the export of sugar, coffee and tobacco to Europe and later to North America.[PARAGRAPH:2]By the middle of the 18th century Havana, the capital city, had more than seventy thousand inhabitants, and was the third largest city in the Americas, ranking behind Lima and Mexico City but ahead of Boston and New York. There were regular proposals in the U.S. to buy Cuba from Spain. During the summer of 1848, President James K. Polk authorized his ambassador to Spain, Romulus Mitchell Saunders, to negotiate the purchase of Cuba and offer Spain up to $100 million, an astonishing sum of money at the time for one territory. Spain, however, refused. Trade in sugar and molasses was $18,000,000 in 1859 alone.[PARAGRAPH:2]A rebellion in 1868 led by Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, a wealthy lawyer landowner from Oriente province who freed his slaves, proclaimed a war and was named President of the Cuban Republic-in-arms, resulted in a prolonged conflict known as the Ten Years' War between pro-independence forces and the Spanish Army. In 1879-1880, Cuban patriot Calixto Garcia attempted to start another war, known in Cuban history as "la guerra chiquita" (the little war) but received little support. During the 1890s, pro-independence agitation revived, fueled by resentment of the restrictions imposed on Cuban trade by Spain and hostility to Spain's increasingly oppressive and incompetent administration of Cuba. In April 1895, a new war was declared, led by the writer and poet Jose Martí who had organized the war over a ten year period while in exile in the U.S. and proclaimed Cuba an independent republic. Martí was killed at Dos Rios shortly after landing in Cuba with the eastern expeditionary force. His death immortalized him and he has become Cuba's undisputed national hero.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Republic of Cuba gained formal independence on 20 May 1902, with the independence leader Tomás Estrada Palma becoming the country's first president. During World War 1, Cuban pilots distinguished themselves fighting for France in the Lafayette Escadrille. In 1934, after a series of coups, Batista and the army, took control of the government, and in 1940, Batista decided to run for President himself. With the support of the Communist-controlled labor unions, Batista was elected President and his administration carried out major social reforms. Several members of the Communist Party held office under his administration. Batista's administration formally took Cuba into World War II as a U.S. ally, declaring war on Japan on December 9, 1941, then on Germany and Italy on December 11, 1941; Cuba, however, did not significantly participate militarily in World War II hostilities. At the end of his term in 1944, in accordance with the constitution, Batista stepped down and Ramón Grau was elected to succeed him. Grau initiated increased government spending on health, education and housing. Grau's "Auténticos" (authentics) were bitter enemies of the Communists and Batista, which opposed most of Grau's program. Grau completed his presidential term. In 1948, Grau was succeeded by Carlos Prío Socarrás, who had been Grau's minister of labor and was particularly hated by the Communists. Corruption was believed to have increased under Prío's administration; however no accusations of corruption were ever proven, and Eduardo Chibás, leader of the Ortodoxo party to which Fidel Castro belonged, committed suicide when his allegations were not substantiated. The 1952 election was a three-way race. Roberto Agramonte of the Ortodoxos party led in all the polls, followed by Dr. Aurelio Hevia of the Auténtico party, and running a distant third was Batista, who was seeking a return to office. Both front runners, Agramonte and Hevia in their own camps, had decided to name Col. Ramon Barquin, then a diplomat in Washington, DC to head the Cuban Armed Forces after the elections. Barquin was a top officer who commanded the respect of the professional army and had promised to eliminate corruption in the ranks. Batista feared that Barquin would oust him and his followers, and when it became apparent that Batista had little chance of winning, he staged a coup on 10 March 1952.[PARAGRAPH:2]On April 4, 1956, a coup by hundreds of career officers led by Col. Barquin (then Vice Chairman of the Inter-American Defense Board in Washington and Cuban Military Attaché of Sea, Air and Land to the US) was betrayed by Rios Morejon. The coup broke the backbone of the Cuban Armed Forces. The officers were sentenced to the maximum terms allowed by Cuban Martial Law. Barquin was sentenced to solitary confinement for 8 years. "La Conspiración de los Puros" (the conspiracy of the pure) resulted in the imprisonment of the top commanding brass of the Armed Forces and the closing of the military academies. Barquin was the founder of La Escuela Superior de Guerra (Cuba's War College) and past director of La Escuela de Cadetes (Cuba's Military Academy). Without Barquin's officers the army's ability to combat the revolutionary insurgents was severely curtailed.[PARAGRAPH:2]On 2 December 1956, a party of 82 revolutionaries, led by Fidel Castro, landed in a yacht named Granma with the intention of establishing an armed resistance movement in the Sierra Maestra. The yacht had come from Mexico, where Castro had been exiled to, and where his army was strengthened with the help of Ernesto Che Guevara. By late 1958, and after staging many terrorist attacks, the rebels had succeeded in breaking out of the Sierra Maestra and launched a general insurrection, joined by hundreds of students and others fleeing Batista's crackdown on dissent in the cities. When the rebels captured Santa Clara, east of Havana, Batista fled the country to exile in Portugal and later Spain.  Then began the summary executions of "suspected" Batista collaborators and members of the opposition through the "paredones" ( firing squad "wall") that took place after show trials. Coupled with the seizure of privately-owned businesses and the rapid demise of the independent press, these atrocities raised questions about the nature of the new government. Castro, along with the hitman for hire, murderous dog, Che Guevara, executed or jailed countless innocent land and bussiness owners for the sole purpose of consolidating power and eliminating opposition. Many who had initially supported the revolution fled the country to join a rapidly growing exile community in Miami.[PARAGRAPH:2]Castro has "successfully" transformed Cuba into a third world nation.

There were regular proposals in the U.S. to buy Cuba from Spain. During the summer of 1848, President James K. Polk authorized his ambassador to Spain, Romulus Mitchell Saunders, to negotiate the purchase of Cuba and offer Spain up to $100 million, an astonishing sum of money at the time for one territory. Spain, however, refused. Trade in sugar and molasses was $18,000,000 in 1859 alone.[PARAGRAPH:2]A rebellion in 1868 led by Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, a wealthy lawyer landowner from Oriente province who freed his slaves, proclaimed a war and was named President of the Cuban Republic-in-arms, resulted in a prolonged conflict known as the Ten Years' War between pro-independence forces and the Spanish Army. In 1879-1880, Cuban patriot Calixto Garcia attempted to start another war, known in Cuban history as "la guerra chiquita" (the little war) but received little support. During the 1890s, pro-independence agitation revived, fueled by resentment of the restrictions imposed on Cuban trade by Spain and hostility to Spain's increasingly oppressive and incompetent administration of Cuba. In April 1895, a new war was declared, led by the writer and poet Jose Martí who had organized the war over a ten year period while in exile in the U.S. and proclaimed Cuba an independent republic. Martí was killed at Dos Rios shortly after landing in Cuba with the eastern expeditionary force. His death immortalized him and he has become Cuba's undisputed national hero.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Republic of Cuba gained formal independence on 20 May 1902, with the independence leader Tomás Estrada Palma becoming the country's first president. During World War 1, Cuban pilots distinguished themselves fighting for France in the Lafayette Escadrille. In 1934, after a series of coups, Batista and the army, took control of the government, and in 1940, Batista decided to run for President himself. With the support of the Communist-controlled labor unions, Batista was elected President and his administration carried out major social reforms. Several members of the Communist Party held office under his administration. Batista's administration formally took Cuba into World War II as a U.S. ally, declaring war on Japan on December 9, 1941, then on Germany and Italy on December 11, 1941; Cuba, however, did not significantly participate militarily in World War II hostilities. At the end of his term in 1944, in accordance with the constitution, Batista stepped down and Ramón Grau was elected to succeed him. Grau initiated increased government spending on health, education and housing. Grau's "Auténticos" (authentics) were bitter enemies of the Communists and Batista, which opposed most of Grau's program. Grau completed his presidential term. In 1948, Grau was succeeded by Carlos Prío Socarrás, who had been Grau's minister of labor and was particularly hated by the Communists. Corruption was believed to have increased under Prío's administration; however no accusations of corruption were ever proven, and Eduardo Chibás, leader of the Ortodoxo party to which Fidel Castro belonged, committed suicide when his allegations were not substantiated. The 1952 election was a three-way race. Roberto Agramonte of the Ortodoxos party led in all the polls, followed by Dr. Aurelio Hevia of the Auténtico party, and running a distant third was Batista, who was seeking a return to office. Both front runners, Agramonte and Hevia in their own camps, had decided to name Col. Ramon Barquin, then a diplomat in Washington, DC to head the Cuban Armed Forces after the elections. Barquin was a top officer who commanded the respect of the professional army and had promised to eliminate corruption in the ranks. Batista feared that Barquin would oust him and his followers, and when it became apparent that Batista had little chance of winning, he staged a coup on 10 March 1952.[PARAGRAPH:2]On April 4, 1956, a coup by hundreds of career officers led by Col. Barquin (then Vice Chairman of the Inter-American Defense Board in Washington and Cuban Military Attaché of Sea, Air and Land to the US) was betrayed by Rios Morejon. The coup broke the backbone of the Cuban Armed Forces. The officers were sentenced to the maximum terms allowed by Cuban Martial Law. Barquin was sentenced to solitary confinement for 8 years. "La Conspiración de los Puros" (the conspiracy of the pure) resulted in the imprisonment of the top commanding brass of the Armed Forces and the closing of the military academies. Barquin was the founder of La Escuela Superior de Guerra (Cuba's War College) and past director of La Escuela de Cadetes (Cuba's Military Academy). Without Barquin's officers the army's ability to combat the revolutionary insurgents was severely curtailed.[PARAGRAPH:2]On 2 December 1956, a party of 82 revolutionaries, led by Fidel Castro, landed in a yacht named Granma with the intention of establishing an armed resistance movement in the Sierra Maestra. The yacht had come from Mexico, where Castro had been exiled to, and where his army was strengthened with the help of Ernesto Che Guevara. By late 1958, and after staging many terrorist attacks, the rebels had succeeded in breaking out of the Sierra Maestra and launched a general insurrection, joined by hundreds of students and others fleeing Batista's crackdown on dissent in the cities. When the rebels captured Santa Clara, east of Havana, Batista fled the country to exile in Portugal and later Spain.  Then began the summary executions of "suspected" Batista collaborators and members of the opposition through the "paredones" ( firing squad "wall") that took place after show trials. Coupled with the seizure of privately-owned businesses and the rapid demise of the independent press, these atrocities raised questions about the nature of the new government. Castro, along with the hitman for hire, murderous dog, Che Guevara, executed or jailed countless innocent land and bussiness owners for the sole purpose of consolidating power and eliminating opposition. Many who had initially supported the revolution fled the country to join a rapidly growing exile community in Miami.[PARAGRAPH:2]Castro has "successfully" transformed Cuba into a third world nation. His "educational" and "social" programs have led to lawyers and doctors working as waiters and cab drivers in order to get some tourist tips. Pre-teen girls resort to prostitution and those lucky enough to have family abroad, can "resolver" (make due) better than those who don't. Hotels, beaches and hospitals, but the native Cuban would be arrested for even voicing the wish to have rights to these locations. However, there is hope among the traumatized, brain-washed population; The National Lottery - and the prize.....a one-way ticket to MIAMI.</Spanish>
