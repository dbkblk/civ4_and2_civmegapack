		<English>[H1]Jose Marti[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Intellectual, Poet and Martyr[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1853-1895[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1][TAB]Jose Marti was a leader of the Cuban independence movement from Spain and as well a renowned poet and writer. He is considered the national hero of Cuba and often referred to as the "Apostle of Cuban Independence".[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1869, at the age of 16, he published his first political writings in the only edition of the newspaper El Diablo Cojuelo. That same year, he published "Abdala," a patriotic drama in verse form in the one-volume La Patria Libre.  Despite this success, in March of that year, colonial authorities shut down the school, interrupting Martí's studies. He came to resent Spanish rule of his homeland at a young age; likewise, he developed a hatred of slavery, which was still practiced in Cuba. On 21 October 1869, he was arrested, then incarcerated in the national jail following an accusation of treason from the Spanish government. More than four months later, Martí assumed responsibility of the charges and was condemned to six years in prison, although he was a 16 year old minor. Eventually Martí fell ill; his legs were severely lacerated due to the chains attached to him. Therefore, he was transferred to another part of Cuba known as Isla de Pinos instead of further imprisonment. Following that, they decided to repatriate him to Spain.[PARAGRAPH:1]In Spain, he studied law and wrote articles on the wrongs of Spanish rule in Cuba, including "El presidio político en Cuba" in 1871. Martí completed his studies, graduated with a bachelor of arts, and obtained his license in civil rights. He then traveled to France, where he spent some time before secretly returning to Cuba under an assumed name in 1877. He was unable to obtain any employment until he accepted a job as a professor of history and literature in Guatemala City. In 1878, he returned to Havana and found work there. His son, Jose Francisco was born there. However, the next year, he was arrested and deported to Spain again. His wife and son remained in Cuba. In 1880, Martí moved to New York City serving as a joint consul there for Uruguay, Paraguay, and Argentina. He mobilized the Cuban exile community, especially in Ybor City (Tampa area) and Key West, Florida, to revolution and independence from Spain, while lobbying to oppose U.S. annexation of Cuba, which some American politicians desired. In January 1892, he founded the Partido Revolucionario Cubano, the Cuban Revolutionary Party, with the purpose of gaining independence for both Cuba and Puerto Rico.[PARAGRAPH:1]On March 25, 1895, José Marti published the Manifesto of Montecristi together with Máximo Gómez, proclaiming Cuban independence, an end to all legal distinctions between the races, friendship with Spaniards who did not oppose the independence, and war with all who stood in the way of independence. On April 11, 1895, Martí landed in Cuba with a small force of rebel exiles, including the Generalísimo Máximo Gómez y Báez. Upon reuniting with the Ejercito Libertador (army of liberators), Martí was given the grade of Major General. José Martí was killed in battle with Spanish troops at the Battle of Dos Ríos on May 19, 1895. Gómez had recognized that the Spaniards had a strong position between palm trees, so he ordered to disengage. Martí was alone and seeing a young courier ride by, he said: "Joven, a la carga" meaning: "Young man, let's charge!" This was around midday, and he was, as always, dressed in a black jacket, riding a white horse, which made him an easy target for the Spanish. The young trooper, Angel de la Guardia,lost his horse and returned to report the loss. The Spanish took possession of the body, buried it close by, then exhumed the body upon realization of it's identity. They are said not to have burned him because they were scared that the ashes would get into their throats and asphyxiate them. Jose Marti is buried in Cementerio Santa Efigenia in Santiago de Cuba. Many have argued that Maceo and others had always spurned Martí for never participating in combat, which may have compelled Martí to that ill-fated suicidal two-man charge. Some of his "Versos sencillos" bore premonition: "Que no me entierren en lo oscuro, A morir como un traidor... Yo soy bueno y como bueno, Moriré de cara al sol." ("May they not bury me in darkness, to die like a traitor... I am good, and as a good man, I will die facing the sun.")</English>
