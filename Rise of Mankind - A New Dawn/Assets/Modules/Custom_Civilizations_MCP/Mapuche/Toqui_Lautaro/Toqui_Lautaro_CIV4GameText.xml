		<English>[H1]Toqui Lautaro [\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Leader of the Mapuche[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 15??  - April 29, 1557[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Lautaro (In Mapudungun: "Lef-Traru": Speedy Crested Caracara) was a Mapuche military leader and protagonist in the War of Arauco. Some of his tactics are currently studied in several war academies around the world. [PARAGRAPH:1]Lautaro was the son of a mapuche "Lonko" (chief for times of peace). When young, he was captured by some Spanish colonizers, and became the personal servant of Don Pedro de Valdivia, Spanish conqueror of Chile. Lautaro learned the military ways and skills of the Spaniards' army by observing Valdivia and his peers. Lautaro escaped from Spanish captivity and rejoined the mapuches as a young adult. With the knowledge he had acquired, he introduced use of horses to the Mapuche, and designed improved tactics for combat against the Spanish. He attracted a large number of otherwise dispersed Mapuche warriors and formed a native army that could fight successfully against the Spanish conquerors. [PARAGRAPH:1]In 1553 the Mapuches held a parliament in which, given the growing Spanish forces and their decision to remain in the territory, it was decided that war was needed to expel them. They chose him as Toqui (wartime chief) because he had served as an assistant for the Spanish cavalry, and was assumed he would know how to fight the conquistadors. [PARAGRAPH:1]He is considered an icon of the War of Arauco and the first Chilean General, for his revolutionary strategies and the responsibility in uniting the dispersed Mapuche people. His name was used by Francisco de Miranda when he founded the Logia Lautaro, an American independence society of the end of 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. Lautaro became a key protagonist in the epic poem La Araucana by Alonso de Ercilla, a major piece of literature about the Spanish conquest of America. In addition, he is also the subject of a poem by Chilean Nobel Literature Prize laureate Pablo Neruda. After this action, Lautaro planned an assault on Santiago, for which he drew scant support from his troops, who soon dwindled to only 600. In October of 1556 he reached in his northward march the river Mataquito, where he destroyed a fortified camp at Peteroa. In Peteroa he repulsed small attacking Spanish forces, first under the command of Diego Cano and later Francisco de Villagra himself. Lautaro retreated towards the river Itata, with the Spaniards in pursuit. From there he launched feelers towards Santiago and instead of confronting them, he gave them the slip and left for the city to attack it. Despite the stealth under which the Mapuches moved, the city leaders knew of the advance, and sent a small expedition to detain them, buying time for word to be sent to Villagra to return to the city. The Spanish forces met in the field, and, presumably by the treason of a fellow Araucano, found out about the disposition of Lautaro's camp. On April 29, 1557 the conquistadors launched a surprise attack from the hills of Caune, obtaining a decisive victory in which Lautaro was killed.</English>
