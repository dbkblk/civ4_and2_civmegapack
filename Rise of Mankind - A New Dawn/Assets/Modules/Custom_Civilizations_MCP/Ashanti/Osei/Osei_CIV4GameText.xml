		<English>[H1]Osei Kofi Tutu I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Asantehene [\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1680? - 1717 [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Osei Kofi Tutu I was one of the co-founders of the Empire of Ashanti, along with Okomfo Anokye, his chief priest. The Ashanti were a powerful, warlike, and highly disciplined people of West Africa, whose history goes back more than 2000 years. The Ashanti are said to be the descendants of those Ethiopians mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and Herodotus who were driven southward by a conquering Egyptian army. Osei Tutu led an alliance of Ashanti states against the regional hegemon, the Denkyira, completely defeating them. Then, through force of arms and diplomacy, he induced the rulers of the other Ashanti city-states to declare allegiance to Kumasi, his capital. Through his career he was closely advised by Okomfo Anokye, his chief Priest.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Empire of Ashanti was officially formed in 1701 and Osei Tutu was crowned Asantehene (King of all Ashanti). He would hold that position until his death in 1717 in a battle against the Akyem.Osei Tutu was the fourth ruler in Asante royal history, succeeding his uncle Obiri Yeboa. The Asante comprise the largest contingent of the Akan or Twi-speaking peoples. Akan societies are matrilineal, with a person belonging to the abusua of his mother. Inheritance, succession and status are lineally determined. Osei Tutu belonged to the Oyoko Abusua.[PARAGRAPH:1]Osei Tutu, assisted by Okomfo Anokye, developed a new constitution for the Union. The Asantahene, who was also the Kumasihene, was at its head, with the kings of the states of the union forming the Confederacy or Union Council. While the power of the asantehene was not absolute, Osei Tutu enjoyed much despotic power. He is arguably one of the most significant black kings in history. He more than tripled the size of his empire through wars of conquest, and expansion, and he brought a sense of dignity back to West Africa.[PARAGRAPH:1]With the Asante Union firmly established and its military organization in place, Osei Tutu embraced on wars of expansion and revenge. Skillfully utilizing a combination of spiritual dogma and political skill, and ably supported by military prowess, Osei Tutu tripled the size of the small kingdom of Kumasi which he had inherited from his uncle Obiri Yeoba and laid the foundation for the Empire of Ashanti in the process.[PARAGRAPH:1]After avenging his uncle's death at the hands of the Dormaa and bringing some recalcitrant states into line, Osei Tutu focused on the Denkyira. In 1701, the absolute defeat of the Denkyira and their abettors, the people of Akyem, brought the Asante to the attention of the Europeans on the coast for the first time. The victory broke the Denkyira hold on the trade path to the coast and cleared the way for the Asante to increase trade with the Europeans.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1717, Osei Tutu was killed in a war against the Akyem. He was struck by bullets from snipers and sharpshooters, who were hiding in the dense forests and the trees as he crossed a river in a canoe.</English>
