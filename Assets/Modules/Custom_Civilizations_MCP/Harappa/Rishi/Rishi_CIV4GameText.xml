		<English>[H1]Rishi[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Priest King of Indus Valley[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c.2500 b.c.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]While the Sumerians developed the world's first monarchy, the Harappans may have developed the first democracy. Very little evidence has been found of a king in the Indus Valley, only one white priest-king idol and a silver crown; not enough to establish that the "royalty" were the rulers. Instead the empire was likely divided into regions with half a dozen cities functioning as capitals and was governed by a group of people. Archeologists have speculated that the Harappan rulers were merchants, ritual specialists and individuals controlling important resources, instead of just one social group controlling the rest. From the construction of the cities however it does appear there were some social classes.[PARAGRAPH:1]Others have also questioned the persistent belief that Harappan society was a realm of religious control ruled by a priest king, arguing that while tribal institutions are likely to have survived into the Harappan period, it also appears to have witnessed the emergence of an early state with rulers who would have initiated and cemented relationships between various social groups.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nevertheless, one of the more famous artefacts retrieved from Harappan ruins remains seated male sculpture, or "Priest King" from Mohenjo-daro. This statue has become a symbol for the Indus valley civilization. Archaeologists discovered the sculpture in Lower town at Mohenjo-Daro in 1927. It was found in an unusual house with ornamental brickwork and a wall niche and was lying between brick foundation walls which once held up a floor.[PARAGRAPH:1]This bearded sculpture wears a fillet around the head, an armband, and a cloak decorated with trefoil patterns that were originally filled with red pigment. The two ends of the fillet fall along the back and though the hair is carefully combed towards the back of the head, no bun is present. The flat back of the head may have held a separately carved bun as is traditional on the other seated figures, or it could have held a more elaborate horn and plumed headdress.[PARAGRAPH:1]The "Priest King" statue was found at Mohenjo-daro in the 1920s and the gold and steatite eyebead apparently worn on the forehead of the "Priest King" was found in Harappa in 1995. "Rishi" is a term meaning "teacher", and has been preferred by some archaeologists when referring to the figure.</English>
