		<English>[TAB]The Algonquian are one of the most populous and widespread North American Native groups, with tribes originally numbering in the hundreds, and hundreds of thousands who still identify with various Algonquian peoples. This grouping consists of peoples that speak Algonquian languages. Among the largest groups are the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe/Chippewa), Algonkins, Cree, Blackfoot, Cheyenne, Shawnee and Abenaki.[PARAGRAPH:2]Before Europeans came into contact, most Algonquians lived by hunting and fishing, although quite a few supplemented their diet by cultivating corn, beans, squash, and (particularly among the Ojibwe) wild rice. The Algonquians of New England (who spoke eastern Algonquian) practiced a seasonal economy. The basic social unit was the village of a few hundred people related by a kinship structure. Villages were temporary and mobile. They moved to locations of greatest natural food supply, often breaking into smaller units or recombining as the circumstances required. This custom resulted in a certain degree of cross-tribal mobility, especially in troubled times.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ojibwe[PARAGRAPH:2]The Ojibwe or Chippewa is the largest group of Native Americans-First Nations north of Mexico, including Métis. They are the third largest in the United States, surpassed only by Cherokee and Navajo. Because they were formerly located mainly around Sault Ste. Marie, at the outlet of Lake Superior, the French referred to them as Saulteurs. Ojibwa who subsequently moved to the prairie provinces of Canada have retained the name Saulteaux. Ojibwa who were originally located about the Mississagi River and made their way to southern Ontario are known as the Mississaugas.[PARAGRAPH:2]As a major component group of the Anishinaabe peoples - which includes the Algonquin, Nipissing, Oji-Cree, Odawa and the Potawatomi - the Ojibwe peoples number over 130,000. They are known for their birch bark canoes, sacred birch bark scrolls, the use of cowrie shells, wild rice, copper points, and for their use of gun technology from the British to defeat and push back the Dakota nation of the Sioux (1745). The Ojibwe Nation was the first to set the agenda for signing more detailed treaties with Canada's leaders before many settlers were allowed too far west. The Midewiwin Society is well respected as the keeper of detailed and complex scrolls of events, history, songs, maps, memories, stories, geometry, and mathematics.[PARAGRAPH:2]Blackfoot[PARAGRAPH:2]The Blackfoot Indians, also known as the Blackfeet Indians reside in the Great Plains of Montana and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The name Blackfoot is said to have come from the color of the peoples’ leather shoes, or moccasins. They had typically dyed or painted the bottoms of their moccasins black, but one story claimed that the Blackfoot Indians walked through ashes of prairie fires, which in turn colored the bottoms of their moccasins black. They had not originally come from the Great Plains of the Mid-West North America, but rather from the upper Northeastern part of the country. The Blackfoot started off as woodland Indians but as they progressively made their way over to the Plains, they had adapted to the ways of life and had become adept to the land. They learned the new lands they traveled to very well and established themselves as one of the most powerful Indian tribes among the Plains in the late 1700’s and earning themselves the name "The Lords of the Plains."[PARAGRAPH:2]Cree[PARAGRAPH:2]Cree is one of the largest group of indigenous peoples in North America, located mainly across Canada and historically in the United States from Minnesota westward but are found today in Montana. The Cree are generally divided into major groups: Naskapi, Montagnais, Attikamekw, James Bay Cree, Moose Cree, Swampy Cree, Woods Cree and Plains Cree. However, among the Cree, they usually referred to themselves collectively as Nehilawe(those who speak our language); they called themselves "Cree" only when speaking English or French. Skilled buffalo hunters and horsemen, the Plains Cree were allied to the Assiniboine and the Sioux before encountering English, Scottish (especially Orcadian) and French settlers in the 16th century. The Cree are the largest group of First Nations in Canada, with over 200,000 members and 135 registered bands.</English>
