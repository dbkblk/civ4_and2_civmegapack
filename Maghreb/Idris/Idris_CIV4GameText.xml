		<English>[H1]Idris II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Sultan of Morocco[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c.791 - 828 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Idris II was the son of Idris I, the founder of the Idrisid dynasty in North Africa. He was born in Volubilis (Morocco) two months after the death of his father. Idris II was the great great grandchild of Hassan, son of Ali the cousin of the prophet Muhammad.[PARAGRAPH:1]The death of Idris I, and the resulting destabilisation of the fledgling Idrisid dynasty state, delighted the Caliph in Baghdad. However, two months later, a concubine of Idris I gave birth to Idris II, who became a quick prodigy.[PARAGRAPH:1]In reference to Idris II, the historian Rom Landau, says: "In the lore of the Moroccans, Idris II was a being of almost magical attributes. An exceptional young man he certainly must have been. At many points we are reminded of one of the greatest sages of Islam, Ibn Sina or Avicenna. At the age of four little Idris apparently could read, at five write, at eight he knew the Koran by heart, and by then is said to have mastered the wisdom of all the outstanding savants. He was of real physical strength as well, and when he became officially sovereign in 805 at the age of thirteen, he had already accomplished feats of endurance that men twice his age could not emulate. His profound Islamic faith enhanced all these advantages and increased the veneration accorded him."[PARAGRAPH:1]Twenty years after his father had done so, Idris II refounded the city Fez on the left bank of the river Fez, opposite to where his father had founded it on the right bank. From there on, Idris II began to unify Maghreb under Islam, establishing its firm allegiance to the belief. After spending 19 years pursuing such purposes, this prodigy died at 35 in 828. For twelve hundred years afterwards, the tradition of monarchy, established by Idris I and II, were continued.[PARAGRAPH:1]</English>
